# Research-Paper-Summarizer

This repo includes the activities we have performed for our research paper summarization project. We used large language models (LLMs), the arXiv dataset, and Hugging Face Spaces for model deployment and fine-tuning to achieve better performance in the research paper domain. Due to resource limitations, we have fine-tuned the model on the financial subset of the dataset.
