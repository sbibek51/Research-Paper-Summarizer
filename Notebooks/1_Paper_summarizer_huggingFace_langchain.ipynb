Initially, a global model is shared with all participa nts, and\\neach agent performs local training epochs by dividing their data into batches\\nand optimizing the model. The prepared local models are then shared with\\nthe server. The FL process follows a series of three steps. Firstly , the FL\\nserver initializes a global model for a speciﬁc task and chooses a gro up of agents\\nknownasparticipants. Thisglobalmodelisthendistributedtothep articipating\\nagents. Secondly, each participant receives the global model and conducts on-\\ndevicetrainingusingtheirlocaldatawhilealsobeneﬁtingfromtheglob almodel.\\nThe participantgeneratesalocalmodel based onthis trainingand s haresit with\\nthe server. Finally, the FL server collects the local models from the participants\\nand combines their model parameters to create an updated global model. A\\nnew subset of agents is selected by the server, and the updated g lobal model\\nis shared with them. This iterative process continues until the globa l model\\nreaches the desired level of convergence.[31]\\nFurthermore, the scheme formulates the optimization problems an d payoﬀ\\nfunctions for both users and Energy Service Providers(ESPs) un der the context\\nof the federated learning framework. To incentivize user participa tion and en-\\ncourage high-quality contributions to the model, a two-layer deep r einforcement\\nlearning (DRL)-based incentive algorithm is devised. Overall, the pro posed\\nscheme presents a comprehensive approach to addressing secur ity, eﬃciency,\\nand privacy concerns in energy data sharing within smart grids. By le veraging\\nfederated learning, edge-cloud collaboration, and innovative incen tive mecha-\\nnisms, the scheme holds the potential to enhance the overall perf ormance and\\neﬀectiveness of AIoT services in the context of smart grids.

       " Document(page_content='6 The role of distributed decision-making and\\ninformation processing in the future energy\\nsystems\\nThe broad adoption of distributed energy resources(DERs), par ticularly renew-\\nable sources of decentralized generation, oﬀers signiﬁcant poten tial to greatly\\nimprove the eﬃciency of electricity distribution. However, as DERs b ecome\\na substantial part of the total energy on the distribution networ k, inadequate\\nintegration processes could lead to imbalanced and unstable tempor ary behav-\\niors. These behaviors could strain the existing infrastructure, po ssibly resulting\\nin power outages and drops in voltage. In a future scenario of a sma rt grid, con-\\nsumers equipped with renewable generation capabilities like solar pane ls and\\nwind turbines could use predictive strategies to optimize how they co nsume en-\\nergy. They would determine when to use, sell, or store the renewab le energy\\nthey generate themselves. This active engagement with the electr ic grid and\\nother consumers would replace the current passive energy consu mption model.\\nCommunication among distributed nodes (consumers) equipped with gen-\\neration, storage, and consumption capabilities could establish a dec entralized\\nframework for decision-making and control. This approach would lea d to im-\\nprovements in both overall energy eﬃciency and cost reduction. H owever, to\\nfully realize the potential beneﬁts of the smart grid concept, a sys tematic set of\\ndesign principles is necessary, along with a comprehensive protocol framework\\nthat facilitates interaction among the various entities in the grid. Fu rthermore,\\nrobust and computationally eﬃcient control and optimization algorit hms are\\ncrucial elements of this endeavor.\\nThe Energy Management System (EMS) utilizes the optimal power ﬂo w\\n(OPF) algorithm to optimize the performance of Distributed Energy Resources\\n(DERs) within a microgrid. By analyzing power network data, the OPF al-\\ngorithm determines optimal set points for DERs [32]. Its primary ob jective is\\ntwofold: minimize the overall cost of the power system while adhering to tech-\\nnical and physical constraints of both the power network and the DERs. The\\nspeed of optimization varies based on speciﬁc scenarios. To achieve this, the\\nEMS relies on diverse input data, including predictions for renewable g enerator\\noutput, local load, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) ch arge status, op-\\nerational limits of dispatchable generators and BESSs, microgrid se curity and\\nreliability thresholds, ancillary service requirements from the utility g rid, and\\nanticipated energy prices [33].\\nAfter the OPF optimization, the determined optimal set points are r elayed\\nto the primarycontrolsystems ofthe DERs. These set points ser veasreferences\\nforactiveandreactivepower,instructingtheinternalvoltagean dcurrentcontrol\\nloops ofthe fast and dynamically eﬃcient powerelectronic converte rsintegrated\\nwithin the DERs. This meticulous process ensures accurate trackin g of the\\ndesignated power values, leading to heightened stability and enhanc ed overall\\nperformance of the microgrid.\\nThe interaction between utility companies and consumers, involving b oth\\n12', metadata={'source': '/content/2310.15468', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='energy generation and consumption aspects, plays a crucial role in the design\\nof smart grids. This interaction diﬀers from traditional power grid p lanning,\\nwhich mainly focuses on matching generation with demand. By integra ting\\nconsiderationsofgenerationandconsumption, theschedulingofp owerandloads\\ncan be optimized more eﬀectively. However, the nature of this utility -consumer\\ninteraction varies depending on the time scales of interaction period s and the\\ndiﬀerent consumer units within the hierarchical structure.\\nFor example, in a microgrid setup, smart homes act as consumer unit s at\\nthe microgrid level, while the microgrid controller serves as a consume r unit\\nat the feeder level, which is one level above. To accommodate the div erse\\nways in which generation and consumption sides interact, a two-sta ge model\\nfor utility-consumer interaction has been suggested. This model c onsists of two\\nphases: initial scheduling, which corresponds to long-term planning , and real-\\ntime scheduling, which pertains to short-term planning.[34][35]\\nThe implementation of demand response (DR) strategies during the initial\\nscheduling establishes a baseline operating point for nodes in the grid , charac-\\nterized by consistent consumer load patterns. However, since th ese DR schemes\\nrely on predictions of renewable generation over the scheduling per iod (e.g., 12\\nor 24 hours), they may not eﬀectively handle the real-time ﬂuctuat ions and in-\\ntermittency in the power grid due to the inevitable diﬀerences betwe en actual\\nand predicted renewable generation. To tackle this challenge and imp rove over-\\nall eﬃciency and stability, it’s advantageous to introduce interactio ns at a ﬁner\\ntime scale (short-term) between utility companies and consumers ( both on the\\ngeneration and consumption sides), nearly in real time. From the co nsumers’\\nperspective, who often prioritize their own interests, the object ive is to make\\noptimal decisions that maximize cumulative proﬁts or minimize expense s by\\nutilizing their local distributed energy resources (DERs).\\nGiven the relatively consistent load proﬁles established by DR scheme s, con-\\nsumers can choose to sell surplus renewable energy to the grid while storing the\\nrest for future use. These decisions are guided by real-time pricing information,\\nallowing consumers to dynamically respond to market conditions.\\nDesigninga distributed decisionschemeforsellingexcessenergywith in ami-\\ncrogrid entails addressing several important factors. Firstly, th e scheme should\\nbe adaptable to changes in consumer behavior, accommodating the potential\\nnumber of smart homes within the microgrid and their dynamic shifts b etween\\nbuying and selling modes. Secondly, the scheme must enable selling-mo de smart\\nhomes to express their willingness to sell surplus energy units, ensu ring that\\nthe units sold align with high willingness levels. To quantify this willingness,\\na measure needs to be established, considering potential variation s across dif-\\nferent smart homes and even within the same home due to changing e nergy\\nunit availability. As a result, the microgrid controller must ensure tha t energy\\nunits sold consistently correspond to elevated willingness metrics ac ross diﬀer-\\nent consumers. Lastly, the scheme should be resilient against collus ion among\\nself-interested selling-mode smart homes, which might provide false willingness\\nmetrics for personal gain. By addressing these factors, a compr ehensive dis-\\ntributed decision scheme can be developed to enhance the eﬃciency of energy\\n13', metadata={'source': '/content/2310.15468', 'page': 12}),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 1}, page_content=\" 2 Measuring the bioeconomy economically: exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data, indicators and their limitations  Abstract  Despite its relevance, measuring the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies remains an arduous task that faces limitations. Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy and moves on to the connections between methods, data and indicators. The present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. The bioeconomy concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis of 84 documents selected through snowballing procedures to find articles measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?'. The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy concept, the methods or models used, the data sources accessed, the indicators calculated, and the limitations reported by the authors. The results of the occurrence and co-occurrence of the codes were extracted and analyzed statistically, indicating that the measurement of bioeconomy (i) need recognize and pursue the proposed concept of holistic bioeconomy; (ii) rarely considered aspects of holistic bioeconomy (3.5%); (iii) is primarily based on the concept of biomass-based bioeconomy–BmBB (94%); (iv) the association with the concept of biosphere–BsBB appeared in 26% of the studies; (v) the biotech-based bioeconomy–BtBB was the least frequent (1.2%); (vi) there is a diversity of methods and models, but the most common are those traditionally used to measure macroeconomic activities, especially input-output models; (vii) depending on the prevailing methods, the data comes from various official statistical databases, such as national accounts and economic activity classification systems; (viii) the most frequently used indicators are value added, employment and GHG emissions; (ix) there are various limitations related to the concept, methods and models, data, indicators and others, like incomplete, missing or lack of data, aggregated data, outdated data or database, and uncertainty of the estimated values, the subjectivity in the bio-shares weighting procedures, and other limitations inherent to methods and models. We conclude that efforts to measure the bioeconomy should be encouraged, starting by recognizing that the measurement of a holistic bioeconomy must be pursued.

Introduction In the last two decades, the bioeconomy has emerged as the promise of a new paradigm toward developing a sustainable economic system (Ferreira et al., 2023). This expectation is based on the renewability of biological resources and the circulation of chemical elements. Thus, the bioeconomic paradigm is superior to the economic system based on finite resources whose stocks are finite and non-renewable (Patermann and Aguilar, 2021). As new political and economic stimuli have been prospected, new ventures have been made in the field of the bioeconomy, leading various countries to adopt specific programs, strategies or guidelines to stimulate the bioeconomy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was the first governmental organization to propose an official agenda for promoting the bioeconomy in 2009 (OECD, 2009). In 2012, the European Union launched its strategy for developing a bioeconomy that connected the economy to nature for sustainable growth (EU 2012, EU 2013). Since then, national governments worldwide have made efforts to promote bioeconomy activities and boost national economies officially. These include the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States and '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 6}, page_content=' 7 Russia in 2012, Malaysia and South Africa in 2013, Germany and Finland in 2014 and France in 2016 (Priefer et al., 2017). Brazil launched its national bioeconomy program in 2019 (BRASIL, 2019), while China includes the bioeconomy in its 14th five-year plan for 2021-2025 (Zhang et al., 2022). Currently, dozens of countries have specific or related bioeconomy strategies (OECD 2018, Gardossi et al. 2023). However, one aspect that differentiates national strategies is the essence of the bioeconomy concept considered when outlining the actions to be stimulated. In the EU, for example, the concept was updated in 2018 to add sectors and systems that rely on biological resources, in addition to those primary sectors that produce renewable biological resources (EC 2018, Kardung et al. 2019)1. Although it is recognized that there is no widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy (NASEM, 2020), in the United States, it can be said that former President Barack Obama\\'s National Bioeconomy Blueprint is based on three main and correlated axes: knowledge, technology and innovation (US, 2012)2. From the North American perspective, the bioeconomy is the economic activities driven by research and innovation in the life sciences and biotechnology, and that are enabled by technological advances in engineering and computing and information sciences (NASEM 2020, Frisvold et al. 2021). Genetic engineering, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology are some driving technological platforms. The Bioeconomy Brazil Program focuses on extracting renewable resources and exploring biodiversity as a strategy for the sustainable development of smallholder  1 “The bioeconomy covers all sectors and systems that rely on biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), their functions and principles. It includes and interlinks: land and marine ecosystems and the services they provide; all primary production sectors that use and produce biological resources (agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture); and all economic and industrial sectors that use biological resources and processes to produce food, feed, bio-based products, energy and services\" (EC 2018). 2 “A critical factor in leveraging biological systems to drive an innovation-based bioeconomy is the strength of the scientific enterprise investigating those systems, including basic and applied research. A robust biological/biomedical R&D enterprise, backed by government, foundations, and for-profit investments, is necessary to produce the new knowledge, ideas, and foundational technologies required to develop products and services that support businesses and industries and help create jobs. Nature has evolved countless biologically based systems with potential for new applications to address problems in health, energy, food, and the environment. Expanding basic knowledge of living systems and their molecular machinery will inspire new concepts for the creation of artificial processes and products that will address current and future needs. A sustained effort to understand and take advantage of natural living systems will produce novel solutions and encourage the growth of the bioeconomy” (US, 2012). '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 7}, page_content=' 8 and indigenous communities (BRASIL, 2019)3. Although other countries adopt slightly different concepts (see Box 2.1 in NASEM 2020), the concepts adopted by the EU, US and Brazil are examples that align with the visions of the bioeconomy reported in scientific literature. In scholarly circles, several authors have differentiated bioeconomy approaches by considering the resources, processes, and effects that activities trigger in the economic and biophysical systems. Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) classified the bioeconomy into (i) bioresources, indicating products composed wholly or in large part of biomass; (ii) biotechnology, products or processes enabled by innovation in the life sciences; and (iii) bioecology, based on sustainable processes and sustainably sourced products. Vivien et al. (2019) categorized the bioeconomy into (i) Type I, an ecological economy, that is compatible with the biosphere constraints; (ii) Type II, a science-based economy driven by industrial biotechnology; and (iii) Type III, a biomass-based economy. Befort (2020) categorized the visions of the bioeconomy based on socio-technical regimes, proposing (i) Biotech-bioeconomy, which is technology-driven, spreading biotechnology into health, food, industry, etc., and industrialization of the living; and (ii) Biomass-bioeconomy, whose mission-driven towards the substitution of oil for biomass. Other variants of classifications, typologies and narratives are explored in the literature, as in Wei, Liu, et al. (2022) and Allain et al. (2022). However, the classifications cited are sufficient to (i) show evidence that a widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy is lacking; (ii) link the national concepts to the visions of the bioeconomy in the literature, being EU closed to bioresources or Type III, US to biotechnology or Type II, and Brazil to bioecology or Type I; and (iii) reflect on what are the implications for the measurement of the bioeconomy.  3 “The Programa Bioecomia Brasil (Sociobiodiversidade) aims to promote partnerships between public authorities, small farmers, family farmers, traditional peoples and communities and their enterprises, and the business sector, to promote and structure production systems based on the sustainable use of sociobiodiversity resources and extractivism, as well as the production and use of energy from renewable sources that allow these segments to participate more in production and economic arrangements that involve the concept of the bioeconomy” (BRASIL, 2019). '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 8}, page_content=\" 9 Despite these conceptual differences, there is interest and effort on the part of stakeholders to show the economic importance of the bioeconomy and to monitor indicators that attract investment to bioeconomy-related activities. Although awareness differ between stakeholders, the economic dimension is still relevant (Zeug et al., 2021). In this regard, Tévécia Ronzon et al. (2020) estimated that the bioeconomy contributed 4.7% of the EU-27's GDP in 2017. In the US, the contribution of the biobased bioeconomy to the national GDP in 2016 was 5.1% and could reach 7.4% (NASEM, 2020). Specifically, the biotechnology-based bioeconomy would have reached 2.0% of the US GDP in 2012, up from 0.004% in 1980. An annual growth rate of over 10% (Carlson, 2016). In Brazil, the bioeconomy value chain accounted for 19.6% of GDP in 2019 (Cicero Zanetti Lima and Pinto, 2022), a higher share than the 13.8% of added value found by Silva, Pereira, and Martins (2018). As highlighted above, there are different concepts and values for the contribution of the bioeconomy to national economies. Monitoring schemes and indicators are currently under development to assess the impacts of bioeconomy and better inform policy-making, but it can be considered a Herculean task (Jander et al. 2020). One question that matters is: how concepts, methods, data and indicators are connected in the process of measuring bioeconomy economically, and what are the limitations involved? A relevant study in this regard is the review by Ferreira et al. (2022) which lists methods, variables and data used to measure the sustainability of the bioeconomy, including the economic dimension. However, the study by Ferreira et al. (2022) does not define concepts nor explore the connections between methods, data, and indicators and their limitations. The present study advances in detailing these connections when applied in the context of measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?' (Kuosmanen et al., 2020a). Therefore, the present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. \"),\n",

Materials and Methods The first step to reach the goal of exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process was to define the concepts of bioeconomy. Once the concepts of the bioeconomy have been defined, the next step was to carry out a content analysis of carefully selected documents. This section describes the methodological procedures used to complete these research steps. The purpose of providing these details is two-fold: First, to inform the reader about how the results were obtained, and second, to ensure that other researchers can replicate the study. The following steps to achieve these goals are explained in detail. 2.1. First Step: Defining the concepts of bioeconomy As mentioned earlier, there is no widely accepted definition for the bioeconomy that incorporates all its idiosyncrasies. However, defining the concept of bioeconomy is crucial for exploring its connections with methods, data, and indicators. To achieve this, a literature review was conducted on scientific articles that reported conceptual analyses, visions, narratives, or approaches to the bioeconomy. The concepts were then organized based on the similarity of their fundamental elements. Three concepts were defined as partial, as they adopted a restricted vision of bioeconomy. Based on the characteristics and limitations of these partial concepts, a concept of holistic bioeconomy was proposed that combines many characteristics and elements of partial concepts. This new concept has advantages for measuring the true value of the bioeconomy. 2.2. Second Step: Articles selection and content analysis This section describes the procedures adopted for searching and selecting articles, building the database, defining the codes, coding the articles’ content and extracting the results.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 10}, page_content=' 11 a. Searching for articles: content analysis requires selecting documents of interest. In this respect, the scope of documents to be retrieved was restricted to measuring bioeconomy economically. The methodological strategy chosen to find documents (scientific articles, technical reports, government reports) fitting to the desired scope follows the snowballing procedures.  Snowballing is a well-established and widely used technique for exploring related documents by identifying articles relevant to your topic of interest from key and cited-by articles (Greenhalgh and Peacock, 2005). In some cases, snowballing proved to be a more efficient method for retrieving articles of interest than the databases themselves (Badampudi et al., 2015), depending on the database (Felizardo et al., 2018). Synthetically, according to Greenhalgh and Peacock (2005), snowballing refers to using the reference list of a paper or the citations to the paper to identify additional papers. Start with a few articles currently in or around your topic of interest. These articles are referred to as ‘start set.’ Once the start set is defined, it is time to conduct backward and forward snowballing. The snowballing procedures followed the steps described by Wohlin (2014), Wohlin (2016) and Wohlin et al. (2022). According to Jalali and Wohlin (2012), systematic literature studies can be done differently regarding the first step. Based on the specificity of the study, we opted to start with the reference lists of a starting set of papers, called the ‘start set.’ The start set of papers was identified in two previous studies by Wesseler and von Braun (2017) and Cingiz et al. (2021), where a list of papers about measuring bioeconomy was presented in Tables 2 and 1, respectively. By merging both tables and excluding duplicated papers, a list of 10 papers remains as the start set, as listed in Table 1.      '),\n",

Source: papers selected from Wesseler and von Braun (2017) and Cingiz et al. (2021).    We began the backward and forward snowballing procedures from the start set papers. Backward snowballing means using the reference list of a starting set paper to identify new documents to include in the literature review, while forward snowballing refers to identifying new papers based on those papers citing the paper being examined (Wohlin 2014). A series of iterations were conducted during backward and forward snowballing. The following procedures were carried out to accomplish the first iteration. Firstly, we took each of the papers from the start set and wholly revised the list of references, searching for '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 12}, page_content=' 13 potentially additional papers to be included in the review database. The question ‘How big is the bioeconomy?’ (Kuosmanen et al., 2020a) illustrates the guiding question we sought in the papers. Secondly, we went to the Scopus database, searched for each paper, and accessed the papers citing it. In the case documents like reports were not indexed in Scopus, we investigated for their citation by filing the query within ‘references’ with the document title. In both the backward and forward snowballing process, the title of the cited or citing papers was evaluated, and, according to the adherence to the goal of the present study, the papers were pre-selected to compose the review database. Then, the pre-selected papers were revised according to the criteria described in the item b - Selecting the articles. From the selected documents, the second iteration started, and the backward (cited) and forward (citing) snowballing was carried out. This process was repeated in five iterations until no additional papers were selected, as shown in Figure 1. b. Selecting the articles: the criteria to include an article in the database are as follows: (i) the word ‘bioeconomy’ or ‘bio-economy’ should appear in the title, abstract, keywords, or at least in the introductory contextualization; (ii) the study should measure some economic aspects of a sector or a bioeconomy system within a local, regional, national, or multi countries’ economies; and, (iii) the study should describe a method to measure the bioeconomy share in the economic system. Studies based on reviews, analyzing national strategies or policies on bioeconomy, describing the bioeconomy based purely on official statistical data or conceptual frameworks, or assessing only socio-environmental aspects of bioeconomy sustainability were excluded from the analysis.  At the end of the snowballing process, 84 documents, including articles and technical or scientific reports, were selected to have their content analyzed. The list with 84 selected documents can be accessed in Appendix A (Supplementary Material). The following sections describe the procedures related to the content analysis.  '),\n",

Building the database: The first step to analyzing the documents’ content was the construction of an appropriate database. To make the process more reliable, we used the software Qualitative Data Analysis–QDA Miner (v. 5), provided by Provalis Research (https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/). The textual content of each document was uploaded to the QDA environment with their year of publication and first author name being assigned as related variables. The associated variables are interesting for comparing results over time and by authors. We opted to compare authors and studies in the present study and did not conduct a temporal analysis. At the end of this process, the textual content of the documents was electronically available to be coded in the QDA Miner environment using the software’s functions. d. Defining the codes: We did not use automated text mining processes in this study. Instead, the content of the documents was personally coded by the authors. The textual content of the documents can be coded using a list of predefined codes or an appropriately designed code structure according to the purpose of the study. Although a list of possible and useful codes could be extracted from literature in studies like Wesseler and von Braun (2017), Karvonen et al. (2017), Lier et al. (2018), Giuntoli et al. (2020), Cingiz et al. (2021) and Ferreira et al. (2022), we decided to construct a particular code structure. \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 14}, page_content=\" 15 Considering the purpose of the study, we defined a fundamental root-code structure based on concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations. The studies' geographical scope (country, region, etc.) was also considered a root code. Only the codes under the root code 'bioeconomy concepts' were predefined based on Sections 2.1 and 4.1. of this article. Thus, only the codes BmBB, BtBB and BsBB could be used in the coding process. The codes for the other root codes were defined as the content was analyzed and coded. In this sense, as new codes were identified, they were added to the code structure. As the list of codes expanded, the codes began to repeat themselves, and the occurrence of additional codes ceased. The final code structure can be found in Appendix B (Supplementary Material). e. Coding the article's content: With the textual database and code structure available in the QDA Miner user interface, the next step was to code the content of the documents. The coding process involves linking a given code to a fraction of the corresponding text. For example, if, during the content analysis, a passage of text that characterized the use of the Biomass-based Bioeconomy concept was identified, this text fragment was selected, and the code 'BmBB' was linked to it. The same procedure was applied to the other codes relating to methods, data, indicators and limitations. Therefore, at the end of the coding process, the content of the 84 documents was coded entirely in terms of aspects relating to bioeconomy concepts, measurement methods, data used, indicators generated and any limitations identified. Finally, a complete review of duplicate codes in the same document was completed, and corrections were made where necessary. f. Extracting the results: A series of results can be extracted from the coded content. In particular, our interest was exploring results that could satisfactorily achieve the study’s goal.

The concepts of bioeconomy: from partial to holistic bioeconomy The lack of a widely accepted definition of the bioeconomy has made it difficult to compare the contributions of the bioeconomy between countries, as well as to plan public policies and make decisions in sectors and activities related to the bioeconomy (Bracco et al. 2018, Highfill and Chambers 2023). In this section, we propose the concept of holistic bioeconomy based on three partial conceptual approaches discussed in the literature and the recognition that these concepts are not mutually exclusive. We argue that the holistic bioeconomy should be considered and pursued in measuring the bioeconomy. 4.1.1. Biomass-based Bioeconomy–BmBB In line with the work of Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016), Vivien et al. (2019), Befort (2020), and Giampietro (2019), this approach seeks to measure the bioeconomy from a concept that bases the bioeconomy on the primary input, biomass or bioresources. Biomass is any primary or secondary organic matter (waste) derived from plants, animals or microorganisms that can be used as a renewable input to produce energy, food, fibers or materials (IEA, 2022). Measuring BmBB, therefore, starts by identifying the primary sectors that produce biomass, which could suggest a narrow view of the bioeconomy. Studies such as that by Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022a), have identified agriculture, livestock and forestry as the primary sectors of the BmBB. However, methodological approaches may differ regarding the method, data and indicators used to measure the BmBB. The fact is that even though biomass is essentially produced in three or four economic sectors, it flows between almost all sectors of the economic system, being consumed or transformed with added value (Figure 2). Thus, measuring '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 16}, page_content=\" 17 BmBB provides information on physical or monetary flows that express how large BmBB is about an economy's GDP, for example. 4.1.2. Biotechnology-based Bioeconomy–BtBB BtBB is the nomination given to the second approach to measuring the bioeconomy. Alternatively, the term 'biotechonomy' can be applied to define the scope of this approach (Blumberga et al., 2016). Conceptually, this approach aligns with the view of bioeconomy as synonymous with biotechnology suggested by Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016), Wei et al. (2022) and Wei, Luo, et al. (2022) and the Type II bioeconomy identified by Vivien et al. (2019) and reinforced by Befort (2020). This approach is based on biotechnologies developed from biological assets (biodiversity) and used to solve society's problems on different fronts: human health and medicine (Red), agriculture (Green), marine (Blue) industry (White), food and nutrition (Yellow), deserts and arid regions (Brown), bioterrorism and biocrime (Black), intellectual properties, patents and publications (Violet), nanobiotechnology and bioinformatics (Gold) environmental protection (Grey) (see Table 1 in Wei, Liu, et al. 2022). BtBB has gained strength from advances in genomics, synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and other modern biotechnology platforms (Kircher et al., 2022). Therefore, while BmBB is based on raw materials, BtBB is based on knowledge, innovation and processes for adding value to biodiversity, including biomass. Measuring BtBB involves identifying the relevant activities and sectors related to biotechnology. Resources, processes and products are integrated into the dynamics of the economic system, increasing the added value and contribution of BtBB in national economies. The intermediate part of Figure 2 represents this conceptual approach. Studies on BtBB measurements suggest investment in R&D and the number of biotechnology patents as indicators (OECD 2023; Highfill and Chambers 2023).   \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 17}, page_content=' 18 4.1.3. Biosphere-based Bioeconomy–BsBB The third conceptual approach to the bioeconomy is the Biosphere-based Bioeconomy (BsBB). While BmBB and BtBB are closely associated with inputs and the technological means for adding value, respectively, BsBB is the broadest and most integrative approach of all. BsBB meets the scope of the bio-ecological vision of the bioeconomy by Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) and the Type I Bioeconomy proposed by Vivien et al. (2019), which associates economic activity with the limits of the biosphere. Therefore, while the BmBB and BtBB approaches consider the national economy as a closed system (open only to the economic system of other countries), the BsBB necessarily implies considering the economic system as an open system that interacts with the biophysical system (biosphere). The biosphere provides the necessary substrates for maintaining and developing all biodiversity, which is the basis of the holistic bioeconomy. 4.1.4. Holistic Bioeconomy The BsBB perspective is relevant because it makes it possible to measure the flows from the biosphere into the economic system and from the economic system into the biosphere. The BtBB intermediates some of these flows, while others are directly exchanged between the BsBB and the BmBB. Therefore, the consumption of flows and stocks and the role of funds for the absorption of waste and pollution become measurable, and aspects relating to the sustainability of the bioeconomy can be gauged (Dafermos, Nikolaidi, and Galanis 2017, Giampietro 2019).  In the 1990s, Odum proposed a challenging task aligning ecology and economics through a new method–the emergy analysis. He aimed to assess the value of energy and materials involved in biological or economic processes converting them into a common unit (sej-solar emjoules). The emergy accounts for directly and indirectly solar energy required to produce the services and products of ecosystems and the national economies (Odum, 1996). It allows calculating the ratio of emergy and money, which is called \"emdolar\", and reveals how much '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 18}, page_content=\" 19 emergy is needed to produce U$ 1 GDP. However, the complexity of this methodology and the lack of an interdisciplinary approach have limited its application in economic science.  \\n Figure 2. The conceptual framework of holistic bioeconomy. In general terms, the central part of the figure (orange) represents the concept of BmBB, indicating the production of biomass as a fundamental input and its intermediate and final flows between the intermediate demand of the economic sectors and the final demand of the government, households and the external market. The intermediate part (purple) represents the concept of BtBB in its different categories of development of biotechnological solutions. BtBB interfaces with the economic system to which it provides its solutions and receives the knowledge of human capital to apply to the biotic resources of the different kingdoms of nature (BsBB). The outermost part of the figure represents the concept of BsBB (green) or, more specifically, the biosphere where the biotic and abiotic resources are located. The biosphere provides the necessary substrates for maintaining and developing all biodiversity, which underpins the holistic bioeconomy. Source: elaborated by the authors.    Despite this, the BsBB approach cannot be ignored in the methods developed for measuring national bioeconomies. The bioeconomy's contributions to sustainability and the environment have already been highlighted in studies such as Bracco et al. (2018) and Highfill and Chambers (2023). Vivien et al. (2019) suggest that lack of emphasis on BsBB is due to a hijacking of Georgescu-Roegen's term ‘Bioeconomy’ by economic activities that want to convey a sustainability appeal. On the other hand, the intransigence of the laws of thermodynamics on which the BsBB is based makes this approach challenging to measure. The laws of thermodynamics may play the role of 'uncomfortable knowledge' in assessing the \\n\"),\n",

However, if we want to take the bioeconomy seriously in its entirety, we need to focus on developing suitable methods to measure its dimension and its implications. Far from a disciplinary approach grounded in economics, an interdisciplinary engagement grounded in a post-normal science will be decisive (Giampietro and Funtowicz, 2020). Therefore, the holistic bioeconomy is a comprehensive approach that involves assessing all relationships between BsBB, BtBB and BmBB. The central issue is that the elements of each concept that contribute to the holistic bioeconomy are expressed in different units of measurement. Direct economic measurement of the holistic bioeconomy is unfeasible because their relationships are not always measured in economic terms (monetary value). Therefore, the system represented by the holistic bioeconomy is complex and challenging to measure, but it needs to be considered, as explained by Giampietro (2019) and Giampietro (2024). 4.2. Authors, documents and countries: A brief characterization  This section characterizes the set of documents regarding their content similarity and shows the countries leading the studies on measuring the economic impact of bioeconomy. Such results are essential to understand the context from which the main results originated.  The first set of results shown in Figure 3 illustrates clusters of documents grouped by degree of similarity. Cosine similarity is one of the most popular similarity measures applied to text documents, such as in numerous information retrieval applications and document clustering (Huang, 2008). Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors obtained from the cosine angle multiplication value of two vectors being compared (Lahitani et al., 2016). Although the Cosine similarity index can take values between -1 and 1, the values range between 0 and 1 in this study. A zero value indicates total dissimilarity between the documents, while a value of 1 means that the documents are entirely '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 20}, page_content=' 21 similar. Documents with a Cosine index greater than 0.5 can be considered to have high similarity. Although Cosine similarity is widely applied in document content analysis, in the case of this study Cosine similarity is based on the occurrence of codes. Therefore, documents with the same codes would result in a cluster with a Cosine similarity value 1. \\nFigure 3. Dendrogram, 3D, and 2D multi-dimension scaling of documents clustered by Cosine Similarity Index. Source: elaborated by the authors based on research data.   \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 21}, page_content=\" 22 Ten main document clusters can be considered based on the similarity of code occurrence. Overall, there is a high degree of similarity between the 84 documents, given that the lowest Cosine index value was higher than 0.5 for all documents. In particular, some documents showed very high similarity, with a Cosine index close to 1. This is the case, for example, with the documents '18 Daystar, J. et al. 2018', '19 Daystar, J. et al. 2019', '27 Golden, J. S. et al., 2016' and '28 Golden, J. S. et al., 2015'. This group of documents consists of a series of technical reports drawn up by a team of researchers and addressed to the US Congress. These authors co-authored the four documents, and each year, the report updates the data using basically the same method, data, and indicators. Another example is documents 64 and 65 by Piotrowski et al. Therefore, the high level of similarity is due to the recurrence of the same codes. Another feature to be highlighted in the formation of clusters is the effect of co-authorship on the grouping of documents. Many of the authors who form the clusters have worked together with the authors of other documents. In this sense, the cluster formed by the documents '15 Cingiz, K. et al. 2021' to '76 van de Pas, J. 2015' is worth highlighting. These clusters represent the efforts of research groups developing joint studies to measure the bioeconomy using relatively similar concepts, methods, data and indicators. The high level of similarity between the documents may also have been affected by the geographical scope of the studies. Only 47 countries had data and indicators from their national economies investigated. However, most of the documents report bioeconomy results from countries that are members of the European Union. Germany has the highest number of records, followed by Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic (Figure 4). Some documents are specific to one country, while others report results from groups of countries, such as EU-28, EU-27, EU-15, and so on. In these cases, the country code was assigned to the document whenever country-specific results could be identified. \"),\n",

Outside the EU, only some countries have been included in studies. Of these, the United States had the highest number of studies on its bioeconomy (5), followed by Japan (3), Norway (3), and China (2). Despite the potential of the bioeconomy, countries in Latin America, Africa, Oceania and Asia need studies that measure their bioeconomy. These initial results illustrate a specific pattern in efforts to measure the bioeconomy. Although the studies used various methods, data, and indicators, studies that proposed cutting-edge or significantly innovative methodologies still needed to be identified. 4.3. Connections between concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations This section is dedicated to presenting the results relating to the connections between bioeconomy concepts, the methods applied to measure them, the data used to calculate indicators, the indicators measured and the limitations related to these aspects.

This is likely due to the concentration of studies in EU member countries, where the official concept of the bioeconomy is more aligned with the biobased economy. In 22 documents, economic and environmental aspects were measured together, and these documents were coded with both concepts (BmBB + BsBB). Three documents measured aspects of the three bioeconomy concepts (BmBB + BsBB + BtBB). Only Carlson's (2016) work was dedicated to measuring aspects of Biotechnology-based Bioeconomy (BtBB) in the United States.   \\n Figure 5.

Several co-occurrences of data sources can also be seen in Figure 7, most notably 'Eurostat' and 'NACE' (21), which are a statistical database and an EU activity classification system, respectively.

On the other hand, the other most frequent limitations are associated with the criteria or lack of precision in bio-share estimates, the geographical scope of studies restricted to the borders of a country or region, and limitations related to the measurement of biotechnology (BtBB). The category of limitations related to indicators was the least relevant, with only three unique limitations. However, these limitations are important to note, as they signal concern about environmental aspects (BsBB), recognize the limitations of the indicator results due to the limitations of the criteria for weighting the participation of biological resources in economic activities and signal the need to develop specific indicators to assess the bioeconomy (BsBB).  5. Discussion 5.1. Concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations in measuring the bioeconomy The impact of the bioeconomy on national economies has led to various efforts to measure its activities and support public policy planning and decision-making. The findings presented in this study make relevant contributions to the efforts to measure national bioeconomies and point to critical limitations that need to be overcome. This section discusses (i) bioeconomy concepts, (ii) methods or models, (iii) data sources, (iv) indicators and (v) limitations involved in efforts to measure the economic dimension of the bioeconomy. As elaborated in Section 2, we recognize the existence of at least three conceptual visions of the bioeconomy: BmBB, BtBB, and BsBB, and we consider that the holistic bioeconomy results from the sum of the three concepts. This perspective is shared by Highfill and Chambers (2023). However, only a few studies recognized the three partial concepts, like Alviar et al. (2021), but are limited in measuring holistic bioeconomy. The recurring concept is restricted and primarily based on the BmBB. This may be due to (i) the concentration of studies '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 34}, page_content=\" 35 in EU member countries which adopt a formal concept of the bioeconomy that refers mainly to the bio-based economy; (ii) the possible lack of knowledge or disregard of other concepts due to possible methodological difficulties; or (iii) the objective and scope of the study.  The BsBB concept was considered by the authors of approximately one-quarter of the studies but not explicitly grounded in ecological economics. Essentially, the studies are restricted to combining the measurement of specific indicators of environmental impacts or resource use combined with socioeconomic performance, such as Asada et al. (2020) and Haddad, Britz, and Börner (2019). Although biotechnology has been advocated as an inclusive and sustainable technological platform for the bioeconomy (Lokko et al., 2018), few studies have been dedicated to measuring the economic impacts of BtBB. Carlson (2016) was the only study that dealt exclusively with BtBB, using data compilation to estimate the contribution of biotechnology to the North American economy. Possibly, the lack of structured data that adequately informs the contributions of BtBB is a limitation. Given this, the few studies considering BtBB have mainly explored the turnover of biotech industries or aspects related to patent registration. Besides this, human resources training and R&D investments have been used to evaluate knowledge capital, generally associated with Knowledge-Based Bioeconomy–KBBE (Kircher et al., 2022). The measurement of the bioeconomy has been based on numerous methods or models, mainly various data compilation and estimation techniques, input-output models (IOMs) and social accounting matrices (SAMs). Macroeconomic studies exploring economic systems' structure and structural changes often resort to IOMs. While IOMs measure the interconnections between economic sectors, SAMs are an expansion of IOMs that add other agents such as government and households (Slovachek, 2023a). Together, IOMs and SAMs make it possible to calculate various dimensions of economic activity, such as \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 35}, page_content=\" 36 intermediate and final demand, technical multipliers, backward and forward linkages, among others.  The studies by Heijman (2016), T. Ronzon et al. (2017), Tévécia Ronzon et al. (2017), Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek (2018), Tévécia Ronzon et al. (2020), Jurga, Loizou, and Rozakis (2021), Cingiz et al. (2021), Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022a), Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022b) and Lazorcakova et al. (2022), for example, used input-output models (IOMs). Variations on IOMs, such as the Multiregional Input-Output Model (MRIO) and Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Model (EEIO) or Environmentally-Extended Multiregional Input-Output Model (EEMRIO), were used by Asada et al. (2020) to aggregate data and measure environmental aspects associated with the bioeconomy, while Wen et al. (2019) combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and IOM to identify the key sectors and the short- and long-term effects of the bioeconomy on Japan's GDP. Measuring the bioeconomy using traditional macroeconomic methods can be justified by using the concept of the bioeconomy restricted to the BmBB, where biomass is the main input and primary production sectors are the key sectors. This sectoral structure makes it possible to use data from national input-output tables and measure the participation of the bioeconomy like any other economic activity. In this sense, the measurement of the BmBB differs little from what is usually measured as agribusiness. Defining the fundamental strategies to be used in measuring the bioeconomy depends on the concept, the method, the geographical scope, and, above all, the availability of data. The unavailability of suitable data has been an obstacle to adequately measuring the bioeconomy. Part of this difficulty is related to the conventional structure of the organization of national accounts, where there is no classification of sectors and activities specific to the bioeconomy and, as stated by Wesseler and von Braun (2017), bioeconomy cuts across sectors and therefore cannot be treated as a traditional sector in economics. Consequently, \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 36}, page_content=\" 37 from the perspective of conventional economic analysis, efforts have been aimed at identifying sectors and activities related to the bioeconomy. National classification systems for economic sectors and activities have been used alone or in combination to delimit the scope of data representative of the bioeconomy. Thus, coding structures for sectors and activities, such as the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities–NACE (Nowicki et al. 2008a, T. Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek 2018, Jurga, Loizou, and Rozakis 2021, Lazorcakova et al. 2022, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b), Classification of the Functions of Government–COFOG, Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services–CICES (Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a), Statistical Classification of Products by Activity in the European Economic Community–PRODCOM (Asada et al. 2020), Classification of Products–CPA (Lazorcakova et al. 2022), in the EU, and the National Income and Product Accounts–NIPAs, North American Industry Classification System–NAICS, North American Product Classification System–NAPCS (Daystar et al. 2020, Highfill and Chambers 2023), IMPLAN Industry Scheme, in the US are examples of classification system used in delimiting bioeconomy. Another strategy to better delimitate the bioeconomy is to estimate the relative share of biomass (bio-share) in the economy's sectors, activities or products. Researchers have resorted to sectoral statistical data such as ISTAT Exploring regional transitions to the bioeconomy using a socio-economic indicator: the case of Italy (D’Adamo et al., 2022), PRODCOM (Robert et al., 2020), NACE (Piotrowski, Carus, and Carrez 2018, Piotrowski, Carus, and Carrez 2019, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017b, Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek 2018), or by combining statistical data with the biomass content in products reported in the scientific literature (Ronzon et al., 2022a) or the opinion of sectoral experts collected through interviews. Alternatively, Lazorcakova et al. (2022) estimated minimum, maximum and middle bio-share based on the classification of products provided \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 37}, page_content=' 38 by the CPA. However, as there is no official data on the subject, determining bio-shares is just as tricky as classifying activities, leaving researchers to use imprecise estimates that compromise the accuracy of the estimated values.  Dozens of indicators have been identified to measure the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies. The measurement of the value added of the bioeconomy has been recurrent in the literature (Heijman 2016, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2020, Daystar et al. 2020, Cingiz et al. 2021, Alviar et al. 2021, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b), as well as the GDP of the bioeconomy (Wen et al. 2019, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a). Other studies have considered the turnover of industries related to the bioeconomy (T. Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017). The socio-economic contributions of the bioeconomy have also been investigated, mainly through the labor market and jobs (Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek 2018, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2020, Daystar et al. 2020, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b). The environmental impacts of the bioeconomy have been assessed in terms of GHG emissions (Alviar et al. 2021, Lazorcakova et al. 2022) or natural resources like land (Haddad, Britz, and Börner 2019). These indicators have been calculated and reported in absolute values, such as $ millions, number of employees, and tons of CO2. Or, in relative terms, such as value added/GDP, turnover/GDP, percentage of jobs/total jobs, and growth rate of these variables over time (Heijman 2016, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2020, Cingiz et al. 2021, Lazorcakova et al. 2022, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b). In general, the indicators used to express the contribution of the bioeconomy to national economies are those traditionally used to measure other economic activities, considering the methods predominantly used. Various limitations have been codified and systematized, with those related to methods or models and data being the most recurrent. Many limitations are inherent to the models, such as the assumptions of constant '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 38}, page_content=\" 39 returns to scale, fixed input structure, industry homogeneity, no supply constraints, and fixed prices, among others, of the IOMs (Slovachek, 2023b). In the same vein, the limitations of the data are closely related to the methods and models used. The limited availability of timely input-output tables is pointed out as a critical limitation of IOM data (van Leeuwen et al., 2005). 5.2. Challenges to overcome the limitations to measure the bioeconomy economically  Jander and Grundmann (2019) state that monitoring bioeconomy transitions and their effects can be considered a Herculean task, as they cannot be easily captured using current economic statistics. The findings of this study reinforce and detail the difficulties and limitations associated with this endeavor. However, it is necessary to move forward, recognizing and confronting the challenges. Of course, many challenges could be listed. Below, we highlight some that are relevant.   The first and perhaps most important question is: which bioeconomy will be measured? In this sense, recognizing the existence of different conceptual approaches and moving towards measuring the holistic bioeconomy is fundamental. It is necessary to consider the complexity surrounding the etymology of the word 'bioeconomy.' Efforts to measure the BmBB are valid and commendable but insufficient. Attempts to measure BsBB use a conceptual perspective restricted to environmental impacts but need to develop an economic approach to these impacts. The few studies considering the BtBB concept have come up against inadequate data. The first challenge inevitably leads to a second: how do you economically measure something that has no market and, therefore, no economic parameters? This challenge is strongly associated with the BsBB concept. In particular, there is a market for various abiotic natural resources, such as oil, land, and minerals. So, the market parameters (supply, demand, price) are known, and such resources \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 39}, page_content=\" 40 can be incorporated into the usual models without major difficulties. The same is not true of various biotic resources that perform ecosystem services or serve as the basis for biotechnology applications and the production of bioengineered solutions, such as multiple microorganisms living in the soil, air and water.  Carbon dioxide is an example of an abiotic resource facing challenges in the current economic scenario. Due to the growth of global economies based on nonrenewable energy, anthropogenic activity fosters greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O (Wu et al., 2024). As a result, the World's climate change discussions from the IPCC are crucial. To ensure the sustainable development of countries, a carbon market is necessary (Piris-Cabezas et al., 2023). However, due to the lack of global market regulation, incorporating carbon accounting in bioeconomic measurement is challenging. Additionally, it is difficult to incorporate the value of green biotechnologies related to carbon sequestration in bioeconomic measurement. Although only biotic resources fall within the scope of the bioeconomy, abiotic resources are essential as life substrates. The economic measurement of the holistic bioeconomy can be disregarded if homo economicus is assumed truly dead (Gowdy and Iorgulescu Polimeni 2005, Fleming 2017). The second challenge gives rise to a third one, which lies at the interface between BsBB and BtBB: how do we establish the proportionality of the contribution between biological organisms (bio-share) and knowledge (knowledge-share) in BtBB? Many biotechnological solutions result from applying accumulated human knowledge and physical resources to biological organisms to produce a desired result: food, plant, or medicine. The book 'The Genesis Machine: Our Quest to Rewrite Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology' by Webb and Hessel (2022) and the microbial cell factory approach (Villaverde, 2010) illustrate this relationship well. Would the new route to insulin production be possible only with the knowledge used to map the genetic code? Could the Escherichia coli produce insulin voluntarily? Neither. The production of synthetic insulin required \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 40}, page_content=\" 41 the knowledge to map the Escherichia coli genome and genetically modify the bacteria to express insulin production through synthetic biology. The economic value and, therefore, the market price of insulin is known, but the bio-share and knowledge-share are unknown. There are many other examples in this direction. The proposition of a system dynamics model for the so-called 'biotechonomy' was proposed by A. Blumberga et al. (2018), but there is much more to be done. A fourth challenge is the inclusion of other sectors and economic activities beyond the primary ones. Most studies have measured the bioeconomy based on a restricted set of primary sectors, especially agriculture, livestock, fishing and forestry. This section assumes that biomass is the bioeconomy's primary input. Although biomass is relevant, other equally valuable biological inputs are produced and used in many sectors. In this sense, sectors such as the biochemical industry, pharmaceuticals, human and animal health, marine, nanobiotechs, and environmental protection are rarely mentioned. However, they should be considered when measuring the holistic bioeconomy. Lastly, and the most daunting challenge, is integrating efforts to measure the holistic bioeconomy. The limitations of the methods, data and indicators used in the restricted measurement of the bioeconomy indicate the difficulty in developing methods, producing data and information, and generating indicators capable of measuring the holistic bioeconomy. The challenge increases when it comes to measuring the bioeconomy economically. In this sense, the growing applications of digitalization and computational resources may be the only way to overcome these challenges. 5.3. Limitations of the study The results reported in the current study were influenced by the scope defined in the purpose and the methodological choices. Consequently, the limitations inherent in the process may have interfered in some way with the outcomes. The main limitations are highlighted below. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 41}, page_content=\" 42 Firstly, the study focused on measuring the economic contribution of the bioeconomy. This delimitation left out other measurements related to the bioeconomy, such as circularity and sustainability in its economic, environmental and social dimensions. The literature review by Ferreira et al. (2022) presents methods and indicators related to the sustainability of the bioeconomy, including the economic dimension. However, our results are more detailed and include limitations. The snowballing strategy for identifying and selecting documents for content analysis may have excluded other documents that, due to variables such as language or journal indexing base, were not cited in the literature consulted. Examples of this are the works by Trigo et al. (2015) for the Argentine bioeconomy and by Silva, Pereira, and Martins (2018), Cicero Zanetti Lima and Pinto (2022) and Cícero Zanetti Lima and Pinto (2022) for the Brazilian bioeconomy. Possibly, other similar studies around the world could have been retrieved, expanding the number of countries measuring their bioeconomy in Figure 4. Therefore, choosing other search strategies could have broadened the spectrum of documents. On the other hand, the studies cited used concepts, methods, data and indicators identified in this study. No predefined structure was used to code the concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations. Instead, the possibility of adding codes as they were identified in the documents was kept open. In addition, we tried to adopt a nomenclature that was as faithful as possible to that used by the authors. These choices may have resulted in a long list of codes; some could have been aggregated, resulting in different values. This is the case, for example, with the codes 'IOM,' 'MRIO' and 'EEIO,' which, alternatively, could have been merged into the code 'IOM.' The subjectivity of the researcher can bias qualitative studies. For this reason, it would be advisable for two or more researchers to code the documents. The QDA Miner software has resources for coding by a team of researchers and \"),\n",

However, due to restrictions on the number of licenses for the software and the researchers' access to the licensed equipment, coding was only carried out by one senior researcher. 6. Conclusions The current study sought to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically and the limitations involved in this process. A literature review was used to define the concepts of bioeconomy, while a set of 84 documents were coded regarding the bioeconomy concepts, the methods and data used, the indicators calculated and the limitations involved in measuring the bioeconomy. Based on the findings, we concluded that (i) the current concepts of bioeconomy are limited because they are partly focused on biomass, knowledge or natural resources; (ii) to overcome the conceptual limitations, we proposed the concept of holistic bioeconomy as a comprehensive approach capable of integrating all the partial attributes of the bioeconomy and measuring its real contribution. We argue the measurement of holistic bioeconomy from an economic perspective, although many others awareness can be connected to this concept; (iii) studies in which authors at least recognize the existence of different concepts of the bioeconomy are rare; (iv) measurements of the bioeconomy have been almost restricted to the concept of biomass-based bioeconomy; (v) dozens of methods, data sources and indicators had been used to measure the bioeconomy; (vi) the most frequently used methods, data sources and indicators are those traditionally used for macroeconomic modeling, especially input-output models; (vii) several limitations exist in the connections between bioeconomy concepts, methods, data and indicators; (viii) the results may be biased by the purpose of the study, the methodological design and the concentration of studies carried out by research groups from EU member countries. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/2403.08886', 'page': 43}, page_content=' 44 The measurement of the bioeconomy in different countries should be encouraged, especially in those where the bioeconomy has great potential. In addition, efforts should be made to overcome existing limitations and qualify bioeconomy measurements, making the results more accurate. However, it is necessary to recognize the existence of distinct conceptual approaches not only in the scientific literature but, fundamentally, in the real bioeconomy. A globally standardized definition of the concepts and methods related to measuring the three types of bioeconomy, or preferably the holistic bioeconomy, will enable comparative studies between countries and the proposal of global public policies aimed at sustainable development. This is the first step towards developing conceptual frameworks that can overcome the limitations listed in this study and the complexity inherent in the process of measuring a holistic bioeconomy. We argue that integrating the digitization efforts underway in various segments of human-nature activities could be one, if not the only, way in this direction.

      "\" 2 Measuring the bioeconomy economically: exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data, indicators and their limitations  Abstract  Despite its relevance, measuring the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies remains an arduous task that faces limitations. Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy and moves on to the connections between methods, data and indicators. The present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. The bioeconomy concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis of 84 documents selected through snowballing procedures to find articles measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?'. The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy concept, the methods or models used, the data sources accessed, the indicators calculated, and the limitations reported by the authors. The results of the occurrence and co-occurrence of the codes were extracted and analyzed statistically, indicating that the measurement of bioeconomy (i) need recognize and pursue the proposed concept of holistic bioeconomy; (ii) rarely considered aspects of holistic bioeconomy (3.5%); (iii) is primarily based on the concept of biomass-based bioeconomy–BmBB (94%); (iv) the association with the concept of biosphere–BsBB appeared in 26% of the studies; (v) the biotech-based bioeconomy–BtBB was the least frequent (1.2%); (vi) there is a diversity of methods and models, but the most common are those traditionally used to measure macroeconomic activities, especially input-output models; (vii) depending on the prevailing methods, the data comes from various official statistical databases, such as national accounts and economic activity classification systems; (viii) the most frequently used indicators are value added, employment and GHG emissions; (ix) there are various limitations related to the concept, methods and models, data, indicators and others, like incomplete, missing or lack of data, aggregated data, outdated data or database, and uncertainty of the estimated values, the subjectivity in the bio-shares weighting procedures, and other limitations inherent to methods and models. We conclude that efforts to measure the bioeconomy should be encouraged, starting by recognizing that the measurement of a holistic bioeconomy must be pursued.

Introduction In the last two decades, the bioeconomy has emerged as the promise of a new paradigm toward developing a sustainable economic system (Ferreira et al., 2023). This expectation is based on the renewability of biological resources and the circulation of chemical elements. Thus, the bioeconomic paradigm is superior to the economic system based on finite resources whose stocks are finite and non-renewable (Patermann and Aguilar, 2021). As new political and economic stimuli have been prospected, new ventures have been made in the field of the bioeconomy, leading various countries to adopt specific programs, strategies or guidelines to stimulate the bioeconomy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was the first governmental organization to propose an official agenda for promoting the bioeconomy in 2009 (OECD, 2009). In 2012, the European Union launched its strategy for developing a bioeconomy that connected the economy to nature for sustainable growth (EU 2012, EU 2013). Since then, national governments worldwide have made efforts to promote bioeconomy activities and boost national economies officially. These include the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States and \"\n",

Brazil launched its national bioeconomy program in 2019 (BRASIL, 2019), while China includes the bioeconomy in its 14th five-year plan for 2021-2025 (Zhang et al., 2022). Currently, dozens of countries have specific or related bioeconomy strategies (OECD 2018, Gardossi et al. 2023). However, one aspect that differentiates national strategies is the essence of the bioeconomy concept considered when outlining the actions to be stimulated. In the EU, for example, the concept was updated in 2018 to add sectors and systems that rely on biological resources, in addition to those primary sectors that produce renewable biological resources (EC 2018, Kardung et al. 2019)1. Although it is recognized that there is no widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy (NASEM, 2020), in the United States, it can be said that former President Barack Obama's National Bioeconomy Blueprint is based on three main and correlated axes: knowledge, technology and innovation (US, 2012)2. From the North American perspective, the bioeconomy is the economic activities driven by research and innovation in the life sciences and biotechnology, and that are enabled by technological advances in engineering and computing and information sciences (NASEM 2020, Frisvold et al. 2021). Genetic engineering, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology are some driving technological platforms. The Bioeconomy Brazil Program focuses on extracting renewable resources and exploring biodiversity as a strategy for the sustainable development of smallholder  1 “The bioeconomy covers all sectors and systems that rely on biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), their functions and principles. It includes and interlinks: land and marine ecosystems and the services they provide; all primary production sectors that use and produce biological resources (agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture); and all economic and industrial sectors that use biological resources and processes to produce food, feed, bio-based products, energy and services\" (EC 2018). 2 “A critical factor in leveraging biological systems to drive an innovation-based bioeconomy is the strength of the scientific enterprise investigating those systems, including basic and applied research. A robust biological/biomedical R&D enterprise, backed by government, foundations, and for-profit investments, is necessary to produce the new knowledge, ideas, and foundational technologies required to develop products and services that support businesses and industries and help create jobs. Nature has evolved countless biologically based systems with potential for new applications to address problems in health, energy, food, and the environment. Expanding basic knowledge of living systems and their molecular machinery will inspire new concepts for the creation of artificial processes and products that will address current and future needs. A sustained effort to understand and take advantage of natural living systems will produce novel solutions and encourage the growth of the bioeconomy” (US, 2012). \"\n",

Although other countries adopt slightly different concepts (see Box 2.1 in NASEM 2020), the concepts adopted by the EU, US and Brazil are examples that align with the visions of the bioeconomy reported in scientific literature. In scholarly circles, several authors have differentiated bioeconomy approaches by considering the resources, processes, and effects that activities trigger in the economic and biophysical systems. Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) classified the bioeconomy into (i) bioresources, indicating products composed wholly or in large part of biomass; (ii) biotechnology, products or processes enabled by innovation in the life sciences; and (iii) bioecology, based on sustainable processes and sustainably sourced products. Vivien et al. (2019) categorized the bioeconomy into (i) Type I, an ecological economy, that is compatible with the biosphere constraints; (ii) Type II, a science-based economy driven by industrial biotechnology; and (iii) Type III, a biomass-based economy. Befort (2020) categorized the visions of the bioeconomy based on socio-technical regimes, proposing (i) Biotech-bioeconomy, which is technology-driven, spreading biotechnology into health, food, industry, etc., and industrialization of the living; and (ii) Biomass-bioeconomy, whose mission-driven towards the substitution of oil for biomass. Other variants of classifications, typologies and narratives are explored in the literature, as in Wei, Liu, et al. (2022) and Allain et al. (2022). However, the classifications cited are sufficient to (i) show evidence that a widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy is lacking; (ii) link the national concepts to the visions of the bioeconomy in the literature, being EU closed to bioresources or Type III, US to biotechnology or Type II, and Brazil to bioecology or Type I; and (iii) reflect on what are the implications for the measurement of the bioeconomy.  3 “The Programa Bioecomia Brasil (Sociobiodiversidade) aims to promote partnerships between public authorities, small farmers, family farmers, traditional peoples and communities and their enterprises, and the business sector, to promote and structure production systems based on the sustainable use of sociobiodiversity resources and extractivism, as well as the production and use of energy from renewable sources that allow these segments to participate more in production and economic arrangements that involve the concept of the bioeconomy” (BRASIL, 2019). \"\n",

      "\" 9 Despite these conceptual differences, there is interest and effort on the part of stakeholders to show the economic importance of the bioeconomy and to monitor indicators that attract investment to bioeconomy-related activities. Although awareness differ between stakeholders, the economic dimension is still relevant (Zeug et al., 2021). In this regard, Tévécia Ronzon et al. (2020) estimated that the bioeconomy contributed 4.7% of the EU-27's GDP in 2017. In the US, the contribution of the biobased bioeconomy to the national GDP in 2016 was 5.1% and could reach 7.4% (NASEM, 2020). Specifically, the biotechnology-based bioeconomy would have reached 2.0% of the US GDP in 2012, up from 0.004% in 1980. An annual growth rate of over 10% (Carlson, 2016). In Brazil, the bioeconomy value chain accounted for 19.6% of GDP in 2019 (Cicero Zanetti Lima and Pinto, 2022), a higher share than the 13.8% of added value found by Silva, Pereira, and Martins (2018). As highlighted above, there are different concepts and values for the contribution of the bioeconomy to national economies. Monitoring schemes and indicators are currently under development to assess the impacts of bioeconomy and better inform policy-making, but it can be considered a Herculean task (Jander et al. 2020). One question that matters is: how concepts, methods, data and indicators are connected in the process of measuring bioeconomy economically, and what are the limitations involved? A relevant study in this regard is the review by Ferreira et al. (2022) which lists methods, variables and data used to measure the sustainability of the bioeconomy, including the economic dimension. However, the study by Ferreira et al. (2022) does not define concepts nor explore the connections between methods, data, and indicators and their limitations. The present study advances in detailing these connections when applied in the context of measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?' (Kuosmanen et al., 2020a). Therefore, the present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. \"\n",

      "\" 10 2. Materials and Methods The first step to reach the goal of exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process was to define the concepts of bioeconomy. Once the concepts of the bioeconomy have been defined, the next step was to carry out a content analysis of carefully selected documents. This section describes the methodological procedures used to complete these research steps. The purpose of providing these details is two-fold: First, to inform the reader about how the results were obtained, and second, to ensure that other researchers can replicate the study. The following steps to achieve these goals are explained in detail. 2.1. First Step: Defining the concepts of bioeconomy As mentioned earlier, there is no widely accepted definition for the bioeconomy that incorporates all its idiosyncrasies. However, defining the concept of bioeconomy is crucial for exploring its connections with methods, data, and indicators. To achieve this, a literature review was conducted on scientific articles that reported conceptual analyses, visions, narratives, or approaches to the bioeconomy. The concepts were then organized based on the similarity of their fundamental elements. Three concepts were defined as partial, as they adopted a restricted vision of bioeconomy. Based on the characteristics and limitations of these partial concepts, a concept of holistic bioeconomy was proposed that combines many characteristics and elements of partial concepts. This new concept has advantages for measuring the true value of the bioeconomy. 2.2.

In this respect, the scope of documents to be retrieved was restricted to measuring bioeconomy economically. The methodological strategy chosen to find documents (scientific articles, technical reports, government reports) fitting to the desired scope follows the snowballing procedures.  Snowballing is a well-established and widely used technique for exploring related documents by identifying articles relevant to your topic of interest from key and cited-by articles (Greenhalgh and Peacock, 2005). In some cases, snowballing proved to be a more efficient method for retrieving articles of interest than the databases themselves (Badampudi et al., 2015), depending on the database (Felizardo et al., 2018). Synthetically, according to Greenhalgh and Peacock (2005), snowballing refers to using the reference list of a paper or the citations to the paper to identify additional papers. Start with a few articles currently in or around your topic of interest. These articles are referred to as ‘start set.’ Once the start set is defined, it is time to conduct backward and forward snowballing. The snowballing procedures followed the steps described by Wohlin (2014), Wohlin (2016) and Wohlin et al. (2022). According to Jalali and Wohlin (2012), systematic literature studies can be done differently regarding the first step. Based on the specificity of the study, we opted to start with the reference lists of a starting set of papers, called the ‘start set.’ The start set of papers was identified in two previous studies by Wesseler and von Braun (2017) and Cingiz et al. (2021), where a list of papers about measuring bioeconomy was presented in Tables 2 and 1, respectively. By merging both tables and excluding duplicated papers, a list of 10 papers remains as the start set, as listed in Table 1.      \"\n",

A series of iterations were conducted during backward and forward snowballing. The following procedures were carried out to accomplish the first iteration. Firstly, we took each of the papers from the start set and wholly revised the list of references, searching for \"\n",

The question ‘How big is the bioeconomy?’ (Kuosmanen et al., 2020a) illustrates the guiding question we sought in the papers. Secondly, we went to the Scopus database, searched for each paper, and accessed the papers citing it. In the case documents like reports were not indexed in Scopus, we investigated for their citation by filing the query within ‘references’ with the document title. In both the backward and forward snowballing process, the title of the cited or citing papers was evaluated, and, according to the adherence to the goal of the present study, the papers were pre-selected to compose the review database. Then, the pre-selected papers were revised according to the criteria described in the item b - Selecting the articles. From the selected documents, the second iteration started, and the backward (cited) and forward (citing) snowballing was carried out. This process was repeated in five iterations until no additional papers were selected, as shown in Figure 1. b. Selecting the articles: the criteria to include an article in the database are as follows: (i) the word ‘bioeconomy’ or ‘bio-economy’ should appear in the title, abstract, keywords, or at least in the introductory contextualization; (ii) the study should measure some economic aspects of a sector or a bioeconomy system within a local, regional, national, or multi countries’ economies; and, (iii) the study should describe a method to measure the bioeconomy share in the economic system. Studies based on reviews, analyzing national strategies or policies on bioeconomy, describing the bioeconomy based purely on official statistical data or conceptual frameworks, or assessing only socio-environmental aspects of bioeconomy sustainability were excluded from the analysis.  At the end of the snowballing process, 84 documents, including articles and technical or scientific reports, were selected to have their content analyzed. The list with 84 selected documents can be accessed in Appendix A (Supplementary Material). The following sections describe the procedures related to the content analysis.  \"\n",

To make the process more reliable, we used the software Qualitative Data Analysis–QDA Miner (v. 5), provided by Provalis Research (https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/). The textual content of each document was uploaded to the QDA environment with their year of publication and first author name being assigned as related variables. The associated variables are interesting for comparing results over time and by authors. We opted to compare authors and studies in the present study and did not conduct a temporal analysis. At the end of this process, the textual content of the documents was electronically available to be coded in the QDA Miner environment using the software’s functions. d. Defining the codes: We did not use automated text mining processes in this study. Instead, the content of the documents was personally coded by the authors. The textual content of the documents can be coded using a list of predefined codes or an appropriately designed code structure according to the purpose of the study. Although a list of possible and useful codes could be extracted from literature in studies like Wesseler and von Braun (2017), Karvonen et al. (2017), Lier et al. (2018), Giuntoli et al. (2020), Cingiz et al. (2021) and Ferreira et al. (2022), we decided to construct a particular code structure. \n",

The studies' geographical scope (country, region, etc.) was also considered a root code. Only the codes under the root code 'bioeconomy concepts' were predefined based on Sections 2.1 and 4.1. of this article. Thus, only the codes BmBB, BtBB and BsBB could be used in the coding process. The codes for the other root codes were defined as the content was analyzed and coded. In this sense, as new codes were identified, they were added to the code structure. As the list of codes expanded, the codes began to repeat themselves, and the occurrence of additional codes ceased. The final code structure can be found in Appendix B (Supplementary Material). e. Coding the article's content: With the textual database and code structure available in the QDA Miner user interface, the next step was to code the content of the documents. The coding process involves linking a given code to a fraction of the corresponding text. For example, if, during the content analysis, a passage of text that characterized the use of the Biomass-based Bioeconomy concept was identified, this text fragment was selected, and the code 'BmBB' was linked to it. The same procedure was applied to the other codes relating to methods, data, indicators and limitations. Therefore, at the end of the coding process, the content of the 84 documents was coded entirely in terms of aspects relating to bioeconomy concepts, measurement methods, data used, indicators generated and any limitations identified. Finally, a complete review of duplicate codes in the same document was completed, and corrections were made where necessary. f. Extracting the results: A series of results can be extracted from the coded content. In particular, our interest was exploring results that could satisfactorily achieve the study’s goal.

The concepts of bioeconomy: from partial to holistic bioeconomy The lack of a widely accepted definition of the bioeconomy has made it difficult to compare the contributions of the bioeconomy between countries, as well as to plan public policies and make decisions in sectors and activities related to the bioeconomy (Bracco et al. 2018, Highfill and Chambers 2023). In this section, we propose the concept of holistic bioeconomy based on three partial conceptual approaches discussed in the literature and the recognition that these concepts are not mutually exclusive. We argue that the holistic bioeconomy should be considered and pursued in measuring the bioeconomy. 4.1.1. Biomass-based Bioeconomy–BmBB In line with the work of Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016), Vivien et al. (2019), Befort (2020), and Giampietro (2019), this approach seeks to measure the bioeconomy from a concept that bases the bioeconomy on the primary input, biomass or bioresources. Biomass is any primary or secondary organic matter (waste) derived from plants, animals or microorganisms that can be used as a renewable input to produce energy, food, fibers or materials (IEA, 2022). Measuring BmBB, therefore, starts by identifying the primary sectors that produce biomass, which could suggest a narrow view of the bioeconomy. Studies such as that by Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022a), have identified agriculture, livestock and forestry as the primary sectors of the BmBB. However, methodological approaches may differ regarding the method, data and indicators used to measure the BmBB. The fact is that even though biomass is essentially produced in three or four economic sectors, it flows between almost all sectors of the economic system, being consumed or transformed with added value (Figure 2). Thus, measuring \"\n",

      "\" 17 BmBB provides information on physical or monetary flows that express how large BmBB is about an economy's GDP, for example. 4.1.2. Biotechnology-based Bioeconomy–BtBB BtBB is the nomination given to the second approach to measuring the bioeconomy. Alternatively, the term 'biotechonomy' can be applied to define the scope of this approach (Blumberga et al., 2016). Conceptually, this approach aligns with the view of bioeconomy as synonymous with biotechnology suggested by Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016), Wei et al. (2022) and Wei, Luo, et al. (2022) and the Type II bioeconomy identified by Vivien et al. (2019) and reinforced by Befort (2020). This approach is based on biotechnologies developed from biological assets (biodiversity) and used to solve society's problems on different fronts: human health and medicine (Red), agriculture (Green), marine (Blue) industry (White), food and nutrition (Yellow), deserts and arid regions (Brown), bioterrorism and biocrime (Black), intellectual properties, patents and publications (Violet), nanobiotechnology and bioinformatics (Gold) environmental protection (Grey) (see Table 1 in Wei, Liu, et al. 2022). BtBB has gained strength from advances in genomics, synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and other modern biotechnology platforms (Kircher et al., 2022). Therefore, while BmBB is based on raw materials, BtBB is based on knowledge, innovation and processes for adding value to biodiversity, including biomass. Measuring BtBB involves identifying the relevant activities and sectors related to biotechnology. Resources, processes and products are integrated into the dynamics of the economic system, increasing the added value and contribution of BtBB in national economies. The intermediate part of Figure 2 represents this conceptual approach. Studies on BtBB measurements suggest investment in R&D and the number of biotechnology patents as indicators (OECD 2023; Highfill and Chambers 2023).   \"\n",

      "\" 18 4.1.3. Biosphere-based Bioeconomy–BsBB The third conceptual approach to the bioeconomy is the Biosphere-based Bioeconomy (BsBB). While BmBB and BtBB are closely associated with inputs and the technological means for adding value, respectively, BsBB is the broadest and most integrative approach of all. BsBB meets the scope of the bio-ecological vision of the bioeconomy by Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) and the Type I Bioeconomy proposed by Vivien et al. (2019), which associates economic activity with the limits of the biosphere. Therefore, while the BmBB and BtBB approaches consider the national economy as a closed system (open only to the economic system of other countries), the BsBB necessarily implies considering the economic system as an open system that interacts with the biophysical system (biosphere). The biosphere provides the necessary substrates for maintaining and developing all biodiversity, which is the basis of the holistic bioeconomy. 4.1.4. Holistic Bioeconomy The BsBB perspective is relevant because it makes it possible to measure the flows from the biosphere into the economic system and from the economic system into the biosphere. The BtBB intermediates some of these flows, while others are directly exchanged between the BsBB and the BmBB. Therefore, the consumption of flows and stocks and the role of funds for the absorption of waste and pollution become measurable, and aspects relating to the sustainability of the bioeconomy can be gauged (Dafermos, Nikolaidi, and Galanis 2017, Giampietro 2019).  In the 1990s, Odum proposed a challenging task aligning ecology and economics through a new method–the emergy analysis. He aimed to assess the value of energy and materials involved in biological or economic processes converting them into a common unit (sej-solar emjoules). The emergy accounts for directly and indirectly solar energy required to produce the services and products of ecosystems and the national economies (Odum, 1996). It allows calculating the ratio of emergy and money, which is called \"emdolar\", and reveals how much \"\n",

In general terms, the central part of the figure (orange) represents the concept of BmBB, indicating the production of biomass as a fundamental input and its intermediate and final flows between the intermediate demand of the economic sectors and the final demand of the government, households and the external market. The intermediate part (purple) represents the concept of BtBB in its different categories of development of biotechnological solutions. BtBB interfaces with the economic system to which it provides its solutions and receives the knowledge of human capital to apply to the biotic resources of the different kingdoms of nature (BsBB). The outermost part of the figure represents the concept of BsBB (green) or, more specifically, the biosphere where the biotic and abiotic resources are located. The biosphere provides the necessary substrates for maintaining and developing all biodiversity, which underpins the holistic bioeconomy. Source: elaborated by the authors.    Despite this, the BsBB approach cannot be ignored in the methods developed for measuring national bioeconomies. The bioeconomy's contributions to sustainability and the environment have already been highlighted in studies such as Bracco et al. (2018) and Highfill and Chambers (2023). Vivien et al. (2019) suggest that lack of emphasis on BsBB is due to a hijacking of Georgescu-Roegen's term ‘Bioeconomy’ by economic activities that want to convey a sustainability appeal. On the other hand, the intransigence of the laws of thermodynamics on which the BsBB is based makes this approach challenging to measure. The laws of thermodynamics may play the role of 'uncomfortable knowledge' in assessing the \n",

However, if we want to take the bioeconomy seriously in its entirety, we need to focus on developing suitable methods to measure its dimension and its implications. Far from a disciplinary approach grounded in economics, an interdisciplinary engagement grounded in a post-normal science will be decisive (Giampietro and Funtowicz, 2020). Therefore, the holistic bioeconomy is a comprehensive approach that involves assessing all relationships between BsBB, BtBB and BmBB. The central issue is that the elements of each concept that contribute to the holistic bioeconomy are expressed in different units of measurement. Direct economic measurement of the holistic bioeconomy is unfeasible because their relationships are not always measured in economic terms (monetary value). Therefore, the system represented by the holistic bioeconomy is complex and challenging to measure, but it needs to be considered, as explained by Giampietro (2019) and Giampietro (2024). 4.2. Authors, documents and countries: A brief characterization  This section characterizes the set of documents regarding their content similarity and shows the countries leading the studies on measuring the economic impact of bioeconomy. Such results are essential to understand the context from which the main results originated.  The first set of results shown in Figure 3 illustrates clusters of documents grouped by degree of similarity. Cosine similarity is one of the most popular similarity measures applied to text documents, such as in numerous information retrieval applications and document clustering (Huang, 2008). Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors obtained from the cosine angle multiplication value of two vectors being compared (Lahitani et al., 2016). Although the Cosine similarity index can take values between -1 and 1, the values range between 0 and 1 in this study. A zero value indicates total dissimilarity between the documents, while a value of 1 means that the documents are entirely \"\n",

      "\" 22 Ten main document clusters can be considered based on the similarity of code occurrence. Overall, there is a high degree of similarity between the 84 documents, given that the lowest Cosine index value was higher than 0.5 for all documents. In particular, some documents showed very high similarity, with a Cosine index close to 1. This is the case, for example, with the documents '18 Daystar, J. et al. 2018', '19 Daystar, J. et al. 2019', '27 Golden, J. S. et al., 2016' and '28 Golden, J. S. et al., 2015'. This group of documents consists of a series of technical reports drawn up by a team of researchers and addressed to the US Congress. These authors co-authored the four documents, and each year, the report updates the data using basically the same method, data, and indicators. Another example is documents 64 and 65 by Piotrowski et al. Therefore, the high level of similarity is due to the recurrence of the same codes. Another feature to be highlighted in the formation of clusters is the effect of co-authorship on the grouping of documents. Many of the authors who form the clusters have worked together with the authors of other documents. In this sense, the cluster formed by the documents '15 Cingiz, K. et al. 2021' to '76 van de Pas, J. 2015' is worth highlighting. These clusters represent the efforts of research groups developing joint studies to measure the bioeconomy using relatively similar concepts, methods, data and indicators. The high level of similarity between the documents may also have been affected by the geographical scope of the studies. Only 47 countries had data and indicators from their national economies investigated. However, most of the documents report bioeconomy results from countries that are members of the European Union. Germany has the highest number of records, followed by Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic (Figure 4). Some documents are specific to one country, while others report results from groups of countries, such as EU-28, EU-27, EU-15, and so on. In these cases, the country code was assigned to the document whenever country-specific results could be identified. \"\n",

Despite the potential of the bioeconomy, countries in Latin America, Africa, Oceania and Asia need studies that measure their bioeconomy. These initial results illustrate a specific pattern in efforts to measure the bioeconomy. Although the studies used various methods, data, and indicators, studies that proposed cutting-edge or significantly innovative methodologies still needed to be identified. 4.3.

In 22 documents, economic and environmental aspects were measured together, and these documents were coded with both concepts (BmBB + BsBB). Three documents measured aspects of the three bioeconomy concepts (BmBB + BsBB + BtBB).

The category of limitations related to indicators was the least relevant, with only three unique limitations. However, these limitations are important to note, as they signal concern about environmental aspects (BsBB), recognize the limitations of the indicator results due to the limitations of the criteria for weighting the participation of biological resources in economic activities and signal the need to develop specific indicators to assess the bioeconomy (BsBB).  5. Discussion 5.1. Concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations in measuring the bioeconomy The impact of the bioeconomy on national economies has led to various efforts to measure its activities and support public policy planning and decision-making. The findings presented in this study make relevant contributions to the efforts to measure national bioeconomies and point to critical limitations that need to be overcome. This section discusses (i) bioeconomy concepts, (ii) methods or models, (iii) data sources, (iv) indicators and (v) limitations involved in efforts to measure the economic dimension of the bioeconomy. As elaborated in Section 2, we recognize the existence of at least three conceptual visions of the bioeconomy: BmBB, BtBB, and BsBB, and we consider that the holistic bioeconomy results from the sum of the three concepts. This perspective is shared by Highfill and Chambers (2023). However, only a few studies recognized the three partial concepts, like Alviar et al. (2021), but are limited in measuring holistic bioeconomy. The recurring concept is restricted and primarily based on the BmBB. This may be due to (i) the concentration of studies \"\n",

The BsBB concept was considered by the authors of approximately one-quarter of the studies but not explicitly grounded in ecological economics. Essentially, the studies are restricted to combining the measurement of specific indicators of environmental impacts or resource use combined with socioeconomic performance, such as Asada et al. (2020) and Haddad, Britz, and Börner (2019). Although biotechnology has been advocated as an inclusive and sustainable technological platform for the bioeconomy (Lokko et al., 2018), few studies have been dedicated to measuring the economic impacts of BtBB. Carlson (2016) was the only study that dealt exclusively with BtBB, using data compilation to estimate the contribution of biotechnology to the North American economy. Possibly, the lack of structured data that adequately informs the contributions of BtBB is a limitation. Given this, the few studies considering BtBB have mainly explored the turnover of biotech industries or aspects related to patent registration. Besides this, human resources training and R&D investments have been used to evaluate knowledge capital, generally associated with Knowledge-Based Bioeconomy–KBBE (Kircher et al., 2022). The measurement of the bioeconomy has been based on numerous methods or models, mainly various data compilation and estimation techniques, input-output models (IOMs) and social accounting matrices (SAMs). Macroeconomic studies exploring economic systems' structure and structural changes often resort to IOMs. While IOMs measure the interconnections between economic sectors, SAMs are an expansion of IOMs that add other agents such as government and households (Slovachek, 2023a). Together, IOMs and SAMs make it possible to calculate various dimensions of economic activity, such as \"\n",

(2017), Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek (2018), Tévécia Ronzon et al. (2020), Jurga, Loizou, and Rozakis (2021), Cingiz et al. (2021), Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022a), Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022b) and Lazorcakova et al. (2022), for example, used input-output models (IOMs). Variations on IOMs, such as the Multiregional Input-Output Model (MRIO) and Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Model (EEIO) or Environmentally-Extended Multiregional Input-Output Model (EEMRIO), were used by Asada et al. (2020) to aggregate data and measure environmental aspects associated with the bioeconomy, while Wen et al. (2019) combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and IOM to identify the key sectors and the short- and long-term effects of the bioeconomy on Japan's GDP. Measuring the bioeconomy using traditional macroeconomic methods can be justified by using the concept of the bioeconomy restricted to the BmBB, where biomass is the main input and primary production sectors are the key sectors. This sectoral structure makes it possible to use data from national input-output tables and measure the participation of the bioeconomy like any other economic activity. In this sense, the measurement of the BmBB differs little from what is usually measured as agribusiness. Defining the fundamental strategies to be used in measuring the bioeconomy depends on the concept, the method, the geographical scope, and, above all, the availability of data. The unavailability of suitable data has been an obstacle to adequately measuring the bioeconomy. Part of this difficulty is related to the conventional structure of the organization of national accounts, where there is no classification of sectors and activities specific to the bioeconomy and, as stated by Wesseler and von Braun (2017), bioeconomy cuts across sectors and therefore cannot be treated as a traditional sector in economics.

      "\" 37 from the perspective of conventional economic analysis, efforts have been aimed at identifying sectors and activities related to the bioeconomy. National classification systems for economic sectors and activities have been used alone or in combination to delimit the scope of data representative of the bioeconomy. Thus, coding structures for sectors and activities, such as the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities–NACE (Nowicki et al. 2008a, T. Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek 2018, Jurga, Loizou, and Rozakis 2021, Lazorcakova et al. 2022, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b), Classification of the Functions of Government–COFOG, Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services–CICES (Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a), Statistical Classification of Products by Activity in the European Economic Community–PRODCOM (Asada et al. 2020), Classification of Products–CPA (Lazorcakova et al. 2022), in the EU, and the National Income and Product Accounts–NIPAs, North American Industry Classification System–NAICS, North American Product Classification System–NAPCS (Daystar et al. 2020, Highfill and Chambers 2023), IMPLAN Industry Scheme, in the US are examples of classification system used in delimiting bioeconomy. Another strategy to better delimitate the bioeconomy is to estimate the relative share of biomass (bio-share) in the economy's sectors, activities or products. Researchers have resorted to sectoral statistical data such as ISTAT Exploring regional transitions to the bioeconomy using a socio-economic indicator: the case of Italy (D’Adamo et al., 2022), PRODCOM (Robert et al., 2020), NACE (Piotrowski, Carus, and Carrez 2018, Piotrowski, Carus, and Carrez 2019, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017b, Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek 2018), or by combining statistical data with the biomass content in products reported in the scientific literature (Ronzon et al., 2022a) or the opinion of sectoral experts collected through interviews. Alternatively, Lazorcakova et al. (2022) estimated minimum, maximum and middle bio-share based on the classification of products provided \"\n",

However, as there is no official data on the subject, determining bio-shares is just as tricky as classifying activities, leaving researchers to use imprecise estimates that compromise the accuracy of the estimated values.  Dozens of indicators have been identified to measure the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies. The measurement of the value added of the bioeconomy has been recurrent in the literature (Heijman 2016, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2020, Daystar et al. 2020, Cingiz et al. 2021, Alviar et al. 2021, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b), as well as the GDP of the bioeconomy (Wen et al. 2019, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a). Other studies have considered the turnover of industries related to the bioeconomy (T. Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017). The socio-economic contributions of the bioeconomy have also been investigated, mainly through the labor market and jobs (Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2017, Tévécia Ronzon and M’Barek 2018, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2020, Daystar et al. 2020, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b). The environmental impacts of the bioeconomy have been assessed in terms of GHG emissions (Alviar et al. 2021, Lazorcakova et al. 2022) or natural resources like land (Haddad, Britz, and Börner 2019). These indicators have been calculated and reported in absolute values, such as $ millions, number of employees, and tons of CO2. Or, in relative terms, such as value added/GDP, turnover/GDP, percentage of jobs/total jobs, and growth rate of these variables over time (Heijman 2016, Tévécia Ronzon et al. 2020, Cingiz et al. 2021, Lazorcakova et al. 2022, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022a, Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis 2022b). In general, the indicators used to express the contribution of the bioeconomy to national economies are those traditionally used to measure other economic activities, considering the methods predominantly used. Various limitations have been codified and systematized, with those related to methods or models and data being the most recurrent. Many limitations are inherent to the models, such as the assumptions of constant \"\n",

In the same vein, the limitations of the data are closely related to the methods and models used. The limited availability of timely input-output tables is pointed out as a critical limitation of IOM data (van Leeuwen et al., 2005). 5.2. Challenges to overcome the limitations to measure the bioeconomy economically  Jander and Grundmann (2019) state that monitoring bioeconomy transitions and their effects can be considered a Herculean task, as they cannot be easily captured using current economic statistics. The findings of this study reinforce and detail the difficulties and limitations associated with this endeavor. However, it is necessary to move forward, recognizing and confronting the challenges. Of course, many challenges could be listed. Below, we highlight some that are relevant.   The first and perhaps most important question is: which bioeconomy will be measured? In this sense, recognizing the existence of different conceptual approaches and moving towards measuring the holistic bioeconomy is fundamental. It is necessary to consider the complexity surrounding the etymology of the word 'bioeconomy.' Efforts to measure the BmBB are valid and commendable but insufficient. Attempts to measure BsBB use a conceptual perspective restricted to environmental impacts but need to develop an economic approach to these impacts. The few studies considering the BtBB concept have come up against inadequate data. The first challenge inevitably leads to a second: how do you economically measure something that has no market and, therefore, no economic parameters? This challenge is strongly associated with the BsBB concept. In particular, there is a market for various abiotic natural resources, such as oil, land, and minerals. So, the market parameters (supply, demand, price) are known, and such resources \"\n",

      "\" 40 can be incorporated into the usual models without major difficulties. The same is not true of various biotic resources that perform ecosystem services or serve as the basis for biotechnology applications and the production of bioengineered solutions, such as multiple microorganisms living in the soil, air and water.  Carbon dioxide is an example of an abiotic resource facing challenges in the current economic scenario. Due to the growth of global economies based on nonrenewable energy, anthropogenic activity fosters greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O (Wu et al., 2024). As a result, the World's climate change discussions from the IPCC are crucial. To ensure the sustainable development of countries, a carbon market is necessary (Piris-Cabezas et al., 2023). However, due to the lack of global market regulation, incorporating carbon accounting in bioeconomic measurement is challenging. Additionally, it is difficult to incorporate the value of green biotechnologies related to carbon sequestration in bioeconomic measurement. Although only biotic resources fall within the scope of the bioeconomy, abiotic resources are essential as life substrates. The economic measurement of the holistic bioeconomy can be disregarded if homo economicus is assumed truly dead (Gowdy and Iorgulescu Polimeni 2005, Fleming 2017). The second challenge gives rise to a third one, which lies at the interface between BsBB and BtBB: how do we establish the proportionality of the contribution between biological organisms (bio-share) and knowledge (knowledge-share) in BtBB? Many biotechnological solutions result from applying accumulated human knowledge and physical resources to biological organisms to produce a desired result: food, plant, or medicine. The book 'The Genesis Machine: Our Quest to Rewrite Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology' by Webb and Hessel (2022) and the microbial cell factory approach (Villaverde, 2010) illustrate this relationship well. Would the new route to insulin production be possible only with the knowledge used to map the genetic code? Could the Escherichia coli produce insulin voluntarily? Neither. The production of synthetic insulin required \"\n",

      "\" 41 the knowledge to map the Escherichia coli genome and genetically modify the bacteria to express insulin production through synthetic biology. The economic value and, therefore, the market price of insulin is known, but the bio-share and knowledge-share are unknown. There are many other examples in this direction. The proposition of a system dynamics model for the so-called 'biotechonomy' was proposed by A. Blumberga et al. (2018), but there is much more to be done. A fourth challenge is the inclusion of other sectors and economic activities beyond the primary ones. Most studies have measured the bioeconomy based on a restricted set of primary sectors, especially agriculture, livestock, fishing and forestry. This section assumes that biomass is the bioeconomy's primary input. Although biomass is relevant, other equally valuable biological inputs are produced and used in many sectors. In this sense, sectors such as the biochemical industry, pharmaceuticals, human and animal health, marine, nanobiotechs, and environmental protection are rarely mentioned. However, they should be considered when measuring the holistic bioeconomy. Lastly, and the most daunting challenge, is integrating efforts to measure the holistic bioeconomy. The limitations of the methods, data and indicators used in the restricted measurement of the bioeconomy indicate the difficulty in developing methods, producing data and information, and generating indicators capable of measuring the holistic bioeconomy. The challenge increases when it comes to measuring the bioeconomy economically. In this sense, the growing applications of digitalization and computational resources may be the only way to overcome these challenges. 5.3. Limitations of the study The results reported in the current study were influenced by the scope defined in the purpose and the methodological choices. Consequently, the limitations inherent in the process may have interfered in some way with the outcomes. The main limitations are highlighted below. \"\n",

      "\" 42 Firstly, the study focused on measuring the economic contribution of the bioeconomy. This delimitation left out other measurements related to the bioeconomy, such as circularity and sustainability in its economic, environmental and social dimensions. The literature review by Ferreira et al. (2022) presents methods and indicators related to the sustainability of the bioeconomy, including the economic dimension. However, our results are more detailed and include limitations. The snowballing strategy for identifying and selecting documents for content analysis may have excluded other documents that, due to variables such as language or journal indexing base, were not cited in the literature consulted. Examples of this are the works by Trigo et al. (2015) for the Argentine bioeconomy and by Silva, Pereira, and Martins (2018), Cicero Zanetti Lima and Pinto (2022) and Cícero Zanetti Lima and Pinto (2022) for the Brazilian bioeconomy. Possibly, other similar studies around the world could have been retrieved, expanding the number of countries measuring their bioeconomy in Figure 4. Therefore, choosing other search strategies could have broadened the spectrum of documents. On the other hand, the studies cited used concepts, methods, data and indicators identified in this study. No predefined structure was used to code the concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations. Instead, the possibility of adding codes as they were identified in the documents was kept open. In addition, we tried to adopt a nomenclature that was as faithful as possible to that used by the authors. These choices may have resulted in a long list of codes; some could have been aggregated, resulting in different values. This is the case, for example, with the codes 'IOM,' 'MRIO' and 'EEIO,' which, alternatively, could have been merged into the code 'IOM.' The subjectivity of the researcher can bias qualitative studies. For this reason, it would be advisable for two or more researchers to code the documents. The QDA Miner software has resources for coding by a team of researchers and \"\n",

However, due to restrictions on the number of licenses for the software and the researchers' access to the licensed equipment, coding was only carried out by one senior researcher. 6. Conclusions The current study sought to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically and the limitations involved in this process. A literature review was used to define the concepts of bioeconomy, while a set of 84 documents were coded regarding the bioeconomy concepts, the methods and data used, the indicators calculated and the limitations involved in measuring the bioeconomy. Based on the findings, we concluded that (i) the current concepts of bioeconomy are limited because they are partly focused on biomass, knowledge or natural resources; (ii) to overcome the conceptual limitations, we proposed the concept of holistic bioeconomy as a comprehensive approach capable of integrating all the partial attributes of the bioeconomy and measuring its real contribution. We argue the measurement of holistic bioeconomy from an economic perspective, although many others awareness can be connected to this concept; (iii) studies in which authors at least recognize the existence of different concepts of the bioeconomy are rare; (iv) measurements of the bioeconomy have been almost restricted to the concept of biomass-based bioeconomy; (v) dozens of methods, data sources and indicators had been used to measure the bioeconomy; (vi) the most frequently used methods, data sources and indicators are those traditionally used for macroeconomic modeling, especially input-output models; (vii) several limitations exist in the connections between bioeconomy concepts, methods, data and indicators; (viii) the results may be biased by the purpose of the study, the methodological design and the concentration of studies carried out by research groups from EU member countries. \"\n",

      "\" 44 The measurement of the bioeconomy in different countries should be encouraged, especially in those where the bioeconomy has great potential. In addition, efforts should be made to overcome existing limitations and qualify bioeconomy measurements, making the results more accurate. However, it is necessary to recognize the existence of distinct conceptual approaches not only in the scientific literature but, fundamentally, in the real bioeconomy. A globally standardized definition of the concepts and methods related to measuring the three types of bioeconomy, or preferably the holistic bioeconomy, will enable comparative studies between countries and the proposal of global public policies aimed at sustainable development. This is the first step towards developing conceptual frameworks that can overcome the limitations listed in this study and the complexity inherent in the process of measuring a holistic bioeconomy. We argue that integrating the digitization efforts underway in various segments of human-nature activities could be one, if not the only, way in this direction.

      "Despite its relevance, measuring the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies remains an arduous task that faces limitations. Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy and moves on to the connections between methods, data and indicators. The present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. The bioeconomy concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis of 84 documents selected through snowballing procedures to find articles measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?'. The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy concept, the methods or models used, the data sources accessed, the indicators calculated, and the limitations reported by the authors. The results of the occurrence and co-occurrence of the codes were extracted and analyzed statistically, indicating that the measurement of bioeconomy (i) need recognize and pursue the proposed concept of holistic bioeconomy; (ii) rarely considered aspects of holistic bioeconomy (3.5%); (iii) is primarily based on the concept of biomass-based bioeconomy–BmBB (94%); (iv) the association with the concept of biosphere–BsBB appeared in 26% of the studies; (v) the biotech-based bioeconomy–BtBB was the least frequent (1.2%); (vi) there is a diversity of methods and models, but the most common are those traditionally used to measure macroeconomic activities, especially input-output models; (vii) depending on the prevailing methods, the data comes from various official statistical databases, such as national accounts and economic activity classification systems; (viii) the most frequently used indicators are value added, employment and GHG emissions; (ix) there are various limitations related to the concept, methods and models, data, indicators and others, like incomplete, missing or lack of data, aggregated data, outdated data or database, and uncertainty of the estimated values, the subjectivity in the bio-shares weighting procedures, and other limitations inherent to methods and models. We conclude that efforts to measure the bioeconomy should be encouraged, starting by recognizing that the measurement of a holistic bioeconomy must be pursued.\n"

      "\"2 Measuring the bioeconomy economically: exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data, indicators and their limitations  Abstract  Despite its relevance, measuring the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies remains an arduous task that faces limitations. Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy and moves on to the connections between methods, data and indicators. The present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. The bioeconomy concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis of 84 documents selected through snowballing procedures to find articles measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?'. The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy\"\n",

Introduction In the last two decades, the bioeconomy has emerged as the promise of a new paradigm toward developing a sustainable economic system (Ferreira et al., 2023). This expectation is based on the renewability of biological resources and the circulation of chemical elements. Thus, the bioeconomic paradigm is superior to the economic system based on finite resources whose stocks are finite and non-renewable (Patermann and Aguilar, 2021). As new political and economic stimuli have been prospected, new ventures have been made in the field of the bioeconomy, leading various countries to adopt specific programs, strategies or guidelines to stimulate the bioeconomy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was the first governmental organization to propose an official agenda for promoting the bioeconomy in 2009 (OECD, 2009).

Currently, dozens of countries have specific or related bioeconomy strategies (OECD 2018, Gardossi et al. 2023). However, one aspect that differentiates national strategies is the essence of the bioeconomy concept considered when outlining the actions to be stimulated. In the EU, for example, the concept was updated in 2018 to add sectors and systems that rely on biological resources, in addition to those primary sectors that produce renewable biological resources (EC 2018, Kardung et al. 2019)1.

In scholarly circles, several authors have differentiated bioeconomy approaches by considering the resources, processes, and effects that activities trigger in the economic and biophysical systems. Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) classified the bioeconomy into (i) bioresources, indicating products composed wholly or in large part of biomass; (ii) biotechnology, products or processes enabled by innovation in the life sciences; and (iii) bioecology, based on sustainable processes and sustainably sourced products.

Monitoring schemes and indicators are currently under development to assess the impacts of bioeconomy and better inform policy-making, but it can be considered a Herculean task (Jander et al. 2020). One question that matters is: how concepts, methods, data and indicators are connected in the process of measuring bioeconomy economically, and what are the limitations involved? A relevant study in this regard is the review by Ferreira et al. (2022) which lists methods, variables and data used to measure the sustainability of the bioeconomy, including the economic dimension.

Materials and Methods The first step to reach the goal of exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process was to define the concepts of bioeconomy. Once the concepts of the bioeconomy have been defined, the next step was to carry out a content analysis of carefully selected documents. This section describes the methodological procedures used to complete these research steps. The purpose of providing these details is two-fold: First, to inform the reader about how the results were obtained, and second, to ensure that other researchers can replicate the study. The following steps to achieve these goals are explained in detail. 2.1.

However, defining the concept of bioeconomy is crucial for exploring its connections with methods, data, and indicators. To achieve this, a literature review was conducted on scientific articles that reported conceptual analyses, visions, narratives, or approaches to the bioeconomy. The concepts were then organized based on the similarity of their fundamental elements. Three concepts were defined as partial, as they adopted a restricted vision of bioeconomy. Based on the characteristics and limitations of these partial concepts, a concept of holistic bioeconomy was proposed that combines many characteristics and elements of partial concepts. This new concept has advantages for measuring the true value of the bioeconomy. 2.2.

In this respect, the scope of documents to be retrieved was restricted to measuring bioeconomy economically. The methodological strategy chosen to find documents (scientific articles, technical reports, government reports) fitting to the desired scope follows the snowballing procedures.  Snowballing is a well-established and widely used technique for exploring related documents by identifying articles relevant to your topic of interest from key and cited-by articles (Greenhalgh and Peacock, 2005). In some cases, snowballing proved to be a more efficient method for retrieving articles of interest than the databases themselves (Badampudi et al., 2015), depending on the database (Felizardo et al., 2018).

The concepts of bioeconomy: from partial to holistic bioeconomy The lack of a widely accepted definition of the bioeconomy has made it difficult to compare the contributions of the bioeconomy between countries, as well as to plan public policies and make decisions in sectors and activities related to the bioeconomy (Bracco et al. 2018, Highfill and Chambers 2023). In this section, we propose the concept of holistic bioeconomy based on three partial conceptual approaches discussed in the literature and the recognition that these concepts are not mutually exclusive. We argue that the holistic bioeconomy should be considered and pursued in measuring the bioeconomy. 4.1.1.

Biomass is any primary or secondary organic matter (waste) derived from plants, animals or microorganisms that can be used as a renewable input to produce energy, food, fibers or materials (IEA, 2022). Measuring BmBB, therefore, starts by identifying the primary sectors that produce biomass, which could suggest a narrow view of the bioeconomy. Studies such as that by Tévécia Ronzon, Iost, and Philippidis (2022a), have identified agriculture, livestock and forestry as the primary sectors of the BmBB.

Alternatively, the term 'biotechonomy' can be applied to define the scope of this approach (Blumberga et al., 2016). Conceptually, this approach aligns with the view of bioeconomy as synonymous with biotechnology suggested by Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016), Wei et al. (2022) and Wei, Luo, et al. (2022) and the Type II bioeconomy identified by Vivien et al. (2019) and reinforced by Befort (2020).

BtBB has gained strength from advances in genomics, synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and other modern biotechnology platforms (Kircher et al., 2022). Therefore, while BmBB is based on raw materials, BtBB is based on knowledge, innovation and processes for adding value to biodiversity, including biomass. Measuring BtBB involves identifying the relevant activities and sectors related to biotechnology. Resources, processes and products are integrated into the dynamics of the economic system, increasing the added value and contribution of BtBB in national economies.

While BmBB and BtBB are closely associated with inputs and the technological means for adding value, respectively, BsBB is the broadest and most integrative approach of all. BsBB meets the scope of the bio-ecological vision of the bioeconomy by Bugge, Hansen, and Klitkou (2016) and the Type I Bioeconomy proposed by Vivien et al. (2019), which associates economic activity with the limits of the biosphere. Therefore, while the BmBB and BtBB approaches consider the national economy as a closed system (open only to the economic system of other countries), the BsBB necessarily implies considering the economic system as an open system that interacts with the biophysical system (biosphere). The biosphere provides the necessary substrates for maintaining and developing all biodiversity, which is the basis of the holistic bioeconomy. 4.1.4. Holistic Bioeconomy The\"\n",

The BtBB intermediates some of these flows, while others are directly exchanged between the BsBB and the BmBB. Therefore, the consumption of flows and stocks and the role of funds for the absorption of waste and pollution become measurable, and aspects relating to the sustainability of the bioeconomy can be gauged (Dafermos, Nikolaidi, and Galanis 2017, Giampietro 2019).

The bioeconomy's contributions to sustainability and the environment have already been highlighted in studies such as Bracco et al. (2018) and Highfill and Chambers (2023). Vivien et al.

Far from a disciplinary approach grounded in economics, an interdisciplinary engagement grounded in a post-normal science will be decisive (Giampietro and Funtowicz, 2020). Therefore, the holistic bioeconomy is a comprehensive approach that involves assessing all relationships between BsBB, BtBB and BmBB. The central issue is that the elements of each concept that contribute to the holistic bioeconomy are expressed in different units of measurement. Direct economic measurement of the holistic bioeconomy is unfeasible because their relationships are not always measured in economic terms (monetary value).

Overall, there is a high degree of similarity between the 84 documents, given that the lowest Cosine index value was higher than 0.5 for all documents. In particular, some documents showed very high similarity, with a Cosine index close to 1. This is the case, for example, with the documents '18 Daystar, J. et al. 2018', '19 Daystar, J. et al. 2019', '27 Golden, J. S. et al., 2016' and '28 Golden, J. S. et al., 2015'. This group of documents consists of a series of technical reports drawn up by a team of researchers and addressed to the US Congress. These authors co-authored the four documents, and each year, the report updates the data using basically the same method, data, and indicators.

Attempts to measure BsBB use a conceptual perspective restricted to environmental impacts but need to develop an economic approach to these impacts.

Due to the growth of global economies based on nonrenewable energy, anthropogenic activity fosters greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O (Wu et al., 2024). As a result, the World's climate change discussions from the IPCC are crucial. To ensure the sustainable development of countries, a carbon market is necessary (Piris-Cabezas et al., 2023).

However, they should be considered when measuring the holistic bioeconomy. Lastly, and the most daunting challenge, is integrating efforts to measure the holistic bioeconomy. The limitations of the methods, data and indicators used in the restricted measurement of the bioeconomy indicate the difficulty in developing methods, producing data and information, and generating indicators capable of measuring the holistic bioeconomy. The challenge increases when it comes to measuring the bioeconomy economically. In this sense, the growing applications of digitalization and computational resources may be the only way to overcome these challenges. 5.3.

This delimitation left out other measurements related to the bioeconomy, such as circularity and sustainability in its economic, environmental and social dimensions. The literature review by Ferreira et al. (2022) presents methods and indicators related to the sustainability of the bioeconomy, including the economic dimension. However, our results are more detailed and include limitations. The snowballing strategy for identifying and selecting documents for content analysis may have excluded other documents that, due to variables such as language or journal indexing base, were not cited in the literature consulted. Examples of this are the works by Trigo et al.

No predefined structure was used to code the concepts, methods, data, indicators and limitations. Instead, the possibility of adding codes as they were identified in the documents was kept open. In addition, we tried to adopt a nomenclature that was as faithful as possible to that used by the authors.

Conclusions The current study sought to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically and the limitations involved in this process. A literature review was used to define the concepts of bioeconomy, while a set of 84 documents were coded regarding the bioeconomy concepts, the methods and data used, the indicators calculated and the limitations involved in measuring the bioeconomy. Based on the findings, we concluded that (i) the current concepts of bioeconomy are limited because they are partly focused on biomass, knowledge or natural resources; (ii) to overcome the conceptual limitations, we proposed the concept of holistic bioeconomy as a\"\n",

In addition, efforts should be made to overcome existing limitations and qualify bioeconomy measurements, making the results more accurate. However, it is necessary to recognize the existence of distinct conceptual approaches not only in the scientific literature but, fundamentally, in the real bioeconomy. A globally standardized definition of the concepts and methods related to measuring the three types of bioeconomy, or preferably the holistic bioeconomy, will enable comparative studies between countries and the proposal of global public policies aimed at sustainable development.

The present study aims to define the concepts and explore the connections . These concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis .\n",

      "The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy concept, the methods or models used, the data sources accessed, the indicators calculated, and the limitations reported by the authors . The results of occurrence and co-occurrence of the codes were extracted and analyzed statistically .\n",

       "'Measuring the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies remains an arduous task that faces limitations. Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of theBioeconomy. The study aims to define the concepts of bioEconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators. The results of the occurrence and co-occurrence of the codes were extracted and analyzed statistically. We conclude that efforts to measure theBioEconomy should be encouraged by recognizing that the measurement of a holistic bio economy must be pursued. The most frequently used indicators are value added, employment and GHG emissions; (ix) there are various limitations related to the concept, methods and models, like incomplete or lack of data, aggregated or outdated values, and other limitations to measure bioshares and other bioeconomies. The research was published in the journal Life Cycle Assessment -A-Full-HP-Fickey -Full-A-LC-Full A-HPAugmented Augmented Dickey-A full-HP Augmented A-F-LCAugmented D-A Full A-LC Augmented Auger A- Full-ALC Auger D-FAugmented A.'"
